<p>The clinic - which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm - says it has been made a 'scapegoat' in the saga</p>
<p>* The chain is currently deluged with 2,000 calls a day from women wanting implants removed</p>

<p>A Harley Street clinic at the centre of the breast implant scare has said the taxpayer should foot the bill to help its patients.</p>
<p>The multi-million-pound cosmetic surgery business, which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm, also claimed it will need a Government loan if it is to help the NHS.</p>
<p>Mel Braham, owner of the Harley Medical Group, said his firm had been made a ‘scapegoat’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business.</p>
<p>The chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women, most of whom want their implants removed.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted PIP</p>
<p>implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010.</p>
<p>This is</p>
<p>around one in three of the 45,000 sold.</p>
<p>Mr</p>
<p>Braham said the business did not have the money, time or space to</p>
<p>remove and replace all the implants – and the NHS should step in.</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent</p>
<p>victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the</p>
<p>Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility.</p>

<p>His comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits.</p>
<p>They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles.</p>
<p>When Anntina Maughan had her  breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results. Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them. Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured. But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West  Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out.Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust. Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer. She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant. Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby. She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.'</p>
<p>Mr Lansley also pointed the finger at Germany, by naming it as the country that approved the French-made PIPs for use in Europe.</p>
<p>Industry experts say that the combination of cut-price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using PIPs to make an extra profit of up to £1,000 per patient.</p>
<p>Tests have confirmed that PIP</p>
<p>implants, which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial-grade</p>
<p>silicone believed to have been made for mattresses, do not cause cancer.</p>
<p>However, the Department of Health</p>
<p>admits they should never have been put in the human body and the Health</p>
<p>Secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to</p>
<p>have it done.</p>
<p>Last Friday,</p>
<p>Mr Lansley said private clinics have a ‘moral duty’ to take them out and</p>
<p>if they don’t, the NHS will step in.</p>
<p>However, the pledge doesn’t</p>
<p>include the replacement of implants.</p>
<p>Many</p>
<p>private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but</p>
<p>two of the largest groups have ignored Mr Lansley’s call.</p>
<p>Transform,</p>
<p>Britain’s biggest cosmetic surgery group, is ‘reviewing its options’.</p>
<p>But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to replace PIP</p>
<p>implants.</p>
<p>The Harley Medical Group has so far removed and replaced</p>
<p>ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past</p>
<p>two years.</p>
<p>Mr Braham, who previously ran a travel</p>
<p>agency in Australasia, said his business couldn’t cope with the panic</p>
<p>from its patients. He said: ‘We don’t have the number of surgeons, the</p>
<p>hospitals and the anaesthetists and we don’t have the financial capacity</p>
<p>to do it for nothing.</p>
<p>‘We</p>
<p>do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of</p>
<p>adding another 13,900 on top of that.’ Instead, he wants the NHS to take</p>
<p>the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the</p>
<p>operating table.</p>
<p>Mr Braham</p>
<p>wants the Health Service to pay for the bulk of the costs. The firm</p>
<p>would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the Government.</p>
<p>The Government however said it would be ‘irresponsible’ of the Harley</p>
<p>Medical Group not to help its patients.</p>
<p>Fazel Fatah, president of the British</p>
<p>Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We find it</p>
<p>outrageous…when women’s peace of mind is at stake, some clinics are</p>
<p>refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care,</p>
<p>particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and</p>
<p>resources.’</p>
<p>Dutch authorities have reversed their earlier advice on PIPs and said women who had the implants should have them removed.</p>
