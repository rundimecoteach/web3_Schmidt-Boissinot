<p>Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</p>

<p>Via a website, he touts his sperm as being organic but a health expert on the show warned that his unusual approach to fatherhood opens the door to spreading viral diseases such as HIV.</p>
<p>Her fears echo those of the FDA which claims Mr Arsenault did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading and found him to be</p>
