<p>University researchers have</p>
<p>debunked the dogma that predators aren't picky eaters, with a new</p>
<p>study finding predator animals that are given a choice of foods</p>
<p>will select a diet that maximizes their chances of reproducing.</p>
<p>The researchers, including</p>
<p>Professor Stephen Simpson, an internationally renowned biologist</p>
<p>from the University of Sydney, have shown for the first time that</p>
<p>predatory animals choose their food on the basis of its</p>
<p>nutritional value rather than just overall calorie content.</p>
<p>The findings, published in the</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday 11 January, are</p>
<p>based on a study of the ground beetle, Anchomenus dorsalis, a</p>
<p>garden insect that feasts on slugs, aphids, moths, beetle larvae</p>
<p>and ants.</p>
<p>The international team of</p>
<p>scientists from the University of Sydney, the universities of</p>
<p>Exeter and Oxford in the UK, Aarhus University in Denmark and</p>
<p>Massey University in New Zealand, collected female beetles from</p>
<p>the wild and split them into two groups in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Half of the beetles were</p>
<p>offered a choice of foods - some that were high in protein and</p>
<p>some that were high in fat. The other half were not given a</p>
<p>choice of foods: some of these beetles were only given high</p>
<p>protein food, while the rest were just given high fat foods.</p>
<p>The beetles that were given a</p>
<p>choice of foods ate the proportions of protein and fat that were</p>
<p>optimal for producing healthy eggs. These beetles produced more</p>
<p>eggs than the other beetles in the study that had no choice of</p>
<p>foods.</p>
<p>"Contrary to standard</p>
<p>dogma, predators do balance their diet and show nutritional</p>
<p>wisdom," said Professor Simpson, an ARC Laureate Fellow in</p>
<p>the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney and</p>
<p>the paper's senior author.</p>
<p>"Although we previously</p>
<p>demonstrated this characteristic in spiders, predatory beetles,</p>
<p>fish, mink and cats, this is the first study to show the adaptive</p>
<p>reasons and benefits of diet selection," Professor Simpson</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>The finding could have</p>
<p>implications for predator killing and eating patterns in</p>
<p>particular environments, with important consequences for food</p>
<p>webs and ecological communities, said Professor Simpson.</p>
<p>"Immediately after winter</p>
<p>hibernation, when both predators and the prey are likely to have</p>
<p>depleted fat stores, predators are likely to kill and eat more</p>
<p>prey than if the prey were rich in fats. Conversely, if some prey</p>
<p>species contain a higher concentration of fats than is optimal</p>
<p>for the predator, then predators should switch their focus</p>
<p>towards more protein-rich prey species."</p>
<p>Previous research on insects</p>
<p>has shown that herbivores such as butterfly larvae and</p>
<p>grasshoppers, and omnivores such as fruit flies and crickets,</p>
<p>select food to give them a balanced diet. This is the first</p>
<p>research to show that predators also select food on the basis of</p>
<p>nutritional value.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Kim Jensen</p>
<p>of the University of Exeter said: "At a time of year when</p>
<p>many of us are focused on healthy eating, it is interesting to</p>
<p>see that predators are also selective about what they eat.</p>
<p>"Biologists have</p>
<p>previously assumed that predators cannot afford to be fussy and</p>
<p>are simply focused on getting the right quantity of food, rather</p>
<p>than quality. We show for the first time that they do actually</p>
<p>select the foods that will give them the right balance of</p>
<p>nutrients."</p>
