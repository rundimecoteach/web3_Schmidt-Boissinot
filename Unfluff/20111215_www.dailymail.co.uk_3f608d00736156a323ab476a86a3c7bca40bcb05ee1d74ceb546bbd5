<p>Ladies searching for Mr Right, look away now. The ‘perfect man’, it seems, does not exist.</p>
<p>While many chaps have positive attributes, the majority are deeply flawed.</p>
<p>In fact, in a study of 2,000 women, most ranked their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.</p>
<p>Included in a list of 20 common shortfalls are failing to make an effort with their partner’s friends, criticising their driving and the inability to multi-task.</p>
<p>Other male failings include leaving the toilet door open, watching too much sport and poor personal grooming.</p>
<p>Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, which commissioned the study, said: ‘It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner.</p>
<p>‘While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won’t get away with.’</p>
<p>The research found a third of women</p>
<p>will turn a blind eye to their man watching too much sport – as long as</p>
<p>they listen to them when it counts.</p>
<p>But one in five women is convinced</p>
<p>her mischievous partner only pretends to listen to them, while others</p>
<p>believe it’s ‘in one ear and out the other’.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one in five</p>
<p>would forgive leaving the toilet seat up, while the leniency also</p>
<p>stretches to those who don’t help with the cooking.</p>
<p>A quarter of women said dodgy dancing</p>
<p>was forgivable, but bugbears such as clothes being left on the bedroom</p>
<p>floor and snoring can count against men.</p>
<p>And guys beware: Leaving the toilet</p>
<p>dirty, not making an effort with their partner’s family and using her</p>
<p>toothbrush are definitely big no-nos.</p>
<p>Leaving out nail clippings, growing a</p>
<p>scruffy beard or being too much of a mummy’s boy are other sure fire</p>
<p>ways to guarantee ‘imperfection’.</p>
<p>Female bosses are better! Women more tolerant of staff checking Facebook or doing personal chores in office hours</p>
<p>When asked what would make the perfect man, a good personality came top, followed by a sense of humour and looks.</p>
<p>Miss McReynolds said: ‘The average guy</p>
<p>may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, but there</p>
<p>are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big</p>
<p>difference.’</p>
