<p>The findings of Cancer in Ottawa 2012 come from 2007 statistics, the latest available from Cancer Care Ontario, which also show new cancer cases and total cancer deaths in Ottawa have increased since the mid-1980s. The average survival rate has increased, however.<p>
<p>The report also shows the four most common cancers diagnosed in the city — female breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer — are not unlike most other areas. But Ottawa does have a lower rate of both prostate and cervical cancer diagnoses than the rest of Ontario.<p>
<p>For men, the most common cancers were prostate, colorectal, lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most deadly of male cancers were lung, colorectal, prostate and pancreatic cancers.<p>
<p>For women, cancer was most prevalent in the breast, lung, colon and body of the uterus. The most deadly were lung, breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.<p>
<p>Overall, survival rates have increased in the city between five-year periods of 1993-1997 and 2003-2007.<p>
<p>The data is about five years old so the report warns the information "may not be a truly representative picture of the current burden of cancer in Ottawa."<p>
<p>You can read the full report here, which will be presented to the Ottawa Board of Health on Jan. 16.<p>
