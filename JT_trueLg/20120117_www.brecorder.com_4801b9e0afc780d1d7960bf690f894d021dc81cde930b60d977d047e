<br>He said this while talking about the cleanliness, beautification and wall chalking in the city, according to a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) statement on Sunday.<br>

<br>Draft for this law has already been prepared.<br>
<br>He said KMC often carries out campaigns for removal of the chalking on walls and ban on such activity was enforced under Section 144 Cr.<br>
<br>PC.<br>
<div>He said the district municipal administrations were already directed to clean the graffiti, so that these ugly blots on the face of city could be removed.<div>
