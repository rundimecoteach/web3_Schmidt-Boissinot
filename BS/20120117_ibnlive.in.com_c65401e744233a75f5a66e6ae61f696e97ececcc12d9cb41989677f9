In view of their reluctance, the bench reiterated its earlier order for availing services of super speciality doctors from outside if the situation so required.“The same may be availed at the cost of the State for giving treatment to the victim girl”, the bench directed.The Superintendent of the SCB Medical College and Hospital (SCBMCH) on Monday submitted a status report on the condition of the girl along with the recommendation of the high level doctors’ team for shifting her to AIIMS for further investigations and better management.The Superintendent stated that all arrangements had been made by the Government for her airlifting to New Delhi, but the kin refused to give consent.�The petitioner, Prabir Kumar Das, submitted that advocate Haladhar Sethi had met the parents of the victim girl and confirmed that they were not willing to send her to New Delhi. The bench asked Das to file an affidavit on the reasons cited by the parents for doing so.The Crime Branch, which is probing the case, also submitted its status report on� two of the accused, Prashant Pradhan and Guna Chandra Swain. All efforts are being made to collect evidence and apprehend the other two accused at the earliest, DSP and Investigating Officer R C Sethy submitted before the court.�The bench also directed the investigating agency to file a further status report on the progress of the investigation on January 18.
