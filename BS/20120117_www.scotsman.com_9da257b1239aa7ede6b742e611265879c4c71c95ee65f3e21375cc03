Pictures: Getty Published on Tuesday 17 January 2012 00:00 The NHS is facing a “neurology timebomb” as the number of people with conditions such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease (MND) increases, experts have said. New figures from Parkinson’s UK show there will be 28 per cent more people with Parkinson’s disease by 2020. At present about 127,000 people have the disease – which affects actor Michael J Fox and boxing legend Muhammad Ali – but this figure is expected to reach 162,000 by 2020.The number suffering from MND is also set to rise by 27 per cent in the same period.At present 50 people are also newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) every week.The Neurological Alliance, which represents more than 70 charities and organisations, yesterday said a neurology timebomb would catch the NHS unawares unless urgent action was taken. It also accused the Westminister government of having its “head in the sand”.The alliance argues that services are being run in a “haphazard way” with no clear strategy in place, and billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is potentially being wasted.It follows a damning report in December from the National Audit Office (NAO) which found emergency hospital admissions for people with neurological conditions have risen by almost a third despite a huge government investment in services.The study said while access to services had improved and waiting times had fallen, key areas of care had got worse.In 2009-10, 14 per cent of people with Parkinson’s disease, MS and MND who were discharged from hospital after an overnight stay were readmitted within 28 days as an emergency.People admitted as an emergency are also often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training, with evidence suggesting this worsens outcomes for patients.Furthermore, the report found delays in diagnosis and treatment.Steve Ford, chairman of the Neurological Alliance and chief executive of Parkinson’s UK, said: “The situation can only get worse. A crisis is looming but the government has its head in the sand.”He added: “When it comes to helping vulnerable people with a neurological condition the government is floundering around in a fog of its own making. We need a leader to champion improvements – a neurology tsar, if you like – backed up with a plan and a strategy.“When diabetes, cancer and stroke were assigned tsars, things really started to happen.“People affected by neurological conditions are fed up with being at the bottom of the government’s ‘to do’ list.”Mr Ford will give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee today in light of the NAO report.Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the MS Society, added: “The government now needs to send a clear message to everyone living with a neurological condition that these services are a priority.”The estimated number of people who have MND in the UK is 4,200, but this is predicted to rise to 5,330 by 2020.Around 100,000 people in the UK have MS.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Our top priority for people living with all neurological conditions is to ensure the Neurological Standards published by Healthcare Improvement Scotland are implemented – they offer the best mechanism for achieving safe, effective and person-centred care.“The standards will help ensure people get the earliest and most appropriate treatment locally, but with access to specialist services when needed. That’s why we’ve provided boards with £1.2 million, to help take the standards forward.” Related Articles Jinky: a hero remembered LAST week, at the family home in Uddingston, Jimmy Johnstone received bad news.
