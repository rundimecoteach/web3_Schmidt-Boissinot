Mr Perfect doesn't exist By Hannah Thomas on Thursday 15 December 2011 Print Share Comment REX Sorry to burst your bubble but according to a study of 2,000 women, the Mr Perfect we're all looking for doesn't exist. Most women ranked their partner as only 69 per cent 'perfect', citing their partners' failure to make an effort with their partner's friends, inability to do more than one thing at a time and poor personal grooming as the most common flaws.'It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner,' says Nikki McReynolds, marketing director at Remington, which commissioned the study. 'While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with.'The poll found that women look for a good personality, a sense of humour and good looks, while dodgy dancing, leaving clothes lying around on the bedroom floor and snoring are sure signs of imperfection.One in five women would forgive leaving the toilet seat up and a lack of culinary skills but men using their girlfriend's toothbrush and not listening were sure fire ways to lose 'perfect' points.'The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of David Beckham, but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference,' says Miss McReynolds.CLICK HERE FOR MORE WORLD NEWS Thursday 15 December 2011 Rate this ...
