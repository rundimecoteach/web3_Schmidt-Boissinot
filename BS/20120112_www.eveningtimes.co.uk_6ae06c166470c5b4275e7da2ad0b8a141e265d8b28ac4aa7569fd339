Research has shown that IVF is most effective and safest when no more than two embryos are used – particularly for older women. Current regulations allow for women over 40 to have three embryos implanted in an IVF treatment cycle. However, research carried out by the University of Glasgow has shown the chances of success are no greater than for two while the risk of complications is higher. A major complication of IVF treatment is multiple pregnancy – the birth of twins or triplets – which is associated with higher rates of pre-eclampsia, premature birth and blood loss. The findings are likely to result in new world-wide guidelines for IVF treatment.
