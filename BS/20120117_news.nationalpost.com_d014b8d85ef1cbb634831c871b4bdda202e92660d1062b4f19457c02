Though women especially should recognize that their “fecundity and fertility” starts to decline precipitously after 32, a man’s semen quality and fertility also worsens with age, according to guidelines endorsed by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. In addition, babies born to fathers of “advanced paternal age” — defined as 40 and older at the time of conception — are at increased risk of genetic disorders, as well as schizophrenia, autism and some forms of cancer, according to the authors. The new guideline to doctors comes amid growing concerns about the number of women delaying childbearing. In Canada, 11 per cent of first births now occur in women aged 35 and older, up from five per cent in 1987. RelatedOnly planet: Why one child is often enoughNot too late to bring back early marriage If the trend holds, society can expect to spend more on intensive care, special care nurseries and community services for children born to older parents who may have developmental, hearing, speech or language problems, the authors say. It could also affect the future growth of the country; women who postpone their first births tend to have fewer babies, if they become pregnant at all. “Widespread pre-conception counselling and education are needed and must be implemented so that the 95 per cent of Canadians who anticipate parenting at some point can make informed decisions,” the authors write in this month’s issue of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada. But while the popular belief is that women are deferring motherhood for their careers, a related survey of more than 1,000 women in Calgary and Edmonton who gave birth to their first child between 2002 and 2003 found that the top three factors influencing timing of pregnancy — regardless of a woman’s age — are relationship security, feeling in control of their life and feeling prepared to be a mother. Less than a third of women cited career goals, though women more than 35 were more likely than younger women to say they felt their biological clock was ticking. “We were really surprised, because that was the colloquial dogma — ‘Oh, I need to get my career underway,’ ” said Suzanne Tough, a professor in pediatrics and community health sciences at the University of Calgary and a co-author of the study, as well as the guideline on delayed child-bearing. “Once women hit 25 . . . it was really the relationship that was the key factor in influencing when they chose to become a parent.” The concern is that women may not realize what they’re risking while they’re waiting. For females, the biologically optimum period for having a baby is between 20 and 35. By age 32, a woman’s fecundity — the probability of getting pregnant in a menstrual cycle — starts an irreversible slide. And getting pregnant is only the beginning. Compared to younger women, women more than 35 are at increased risk of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies (where the fertilized egg implants outside the womb), diabetes, high blood pressure, placental abnormalities, multiple births and C-section deliveries. Babies born to older mothers are at higher risk of low birth weight, premature birth, chromosomal abnormalities, stillbirth and fetal death. They’re more likely to need intensive care support and to have long-term health complications and challenges at school, Tough said. For men, age affects fertility a number of ways, she and her co-authors write. Older men tend to have “decreased coital frequency” and are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction. In addition, the volume, motility and percent of normal sperm decrease with age. Reproductive health isn’t just about women, said Tough, leader of a $5 million research team trying to reduce preterm births. “It’s about men and women and couples and families.” “The purpose of the guidelines is to enable couples to make informed decisions. There’s a couple in this — not just a woman or not just a man or not just a baby.” Women 35 years of age and older should be offered screening for chromosomal abnormalities and undergo a thorough second trimester ultrasound to look for “significant fetal defects”, especially heart defects, according to the guideline. It also warns that while assisted baby-making technologies may be pushing the boundaries of reproduction, they can’t guarantee a live birth; neither can they “compensate completely” for the natural fall off in fertility due to aging. For example, the live birth rate per cycle of in vitro fertilization falls from about 31 per cent at age 35, to less than five per cent by age 42. “Often what we hear is, ‘If I’d known this sooner, I would have made a different decision,’ ” Tough said.
