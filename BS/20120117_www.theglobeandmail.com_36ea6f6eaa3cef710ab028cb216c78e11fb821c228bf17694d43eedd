Since taking office in 2006, the federal bureaucracy had grown by some 33,000 jobs and federal spending has increased by $75-billion or 43 per cent. Now the government has determined it is time to cut back.Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who is responsible for the CFIA, said in an e-mail on Monday that “Canadian families can be assured that the safety of our food supply will not be affected as federal departments and agencies look for ways to be more efficient and more financially prudent with taxpayer’s dollars.”But neither Mr. Ritz nor his department could explain how food safety would remain unscathed by the loss of inspectors in meat processing plants.Malcolm Allen, the agriculture critic for the opposition New Democrats, said food safety should be spared when the government makes its cuts. “This is really irresponsible on the government’s part to really take a machete when they need to take a scalpel,” he said. “This is one group that in my view should have been left alone.” More related to this story Food no safer than before tainted-meat scandal, union says Flaherty won't take one-scythe-fits-all approach to 2012 budget McGuinty, Harper and the politics of spending cuts Flaherty’s tax credits cost Ottawa billions Conservatives push for deeper cuts to keep budget on track Union slams ‘absurd choice’ between balanced budget, public services Flaherty’s corporate-tax plan hits stumbling block in Ontario Ottawa weighs sweeping review of tax system Deeper cuts mean bigger bonuses, senior bureaucrats told Tories waste no time hitting brakes on spending, watchdog finds 76 comments Email Tweet Print/License Decrease text size Increase text size Today's Must Reads Globe Drive Deals of the week: Always read the fine print Sports Plushenko vs. Chan: Get ready for a skating showdown Globe Investor Is now the time to lock in my mortgage?
