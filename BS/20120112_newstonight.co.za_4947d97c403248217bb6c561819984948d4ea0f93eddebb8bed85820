They are of the opinion that cannabis users can withdraw from it and are surveying on a new drug, namely Sativex. As per the Director of Australia's Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre, Prof. Jan Copeland, cannabis users are at risk of having respiratory problems and there is no particular targeted drug available for helping them quit their habit. However, researchers say that it has been found that Sativex is a blend of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as well as cannabidiol (CBD), the two main cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. It is helpful in managing cannabis withdrawal. Also, it is revealed that smoked cannabis available in the market does not contain CBD, which is found to be a good cannabinoid. In fact, it only contains THC, which is associated with getting stoned. Sativex, which is a botanical extract of cannabis, managed through a mouth spray, is found to be highly useful in the condition, say researchers. Thus, Prof. Copeland remarks that if evidence is found that Sativex is useful enough for cannabis users, they would test it in community-based studies. Also, "If that also proves to be successful, we will for the first time ever have a targeted medication for the management of cannabis withdrawal", he added. Further, being a mouth spray, Sativex helps to avoid the problems in respiratory system that are associated with cannabis smoke, say reports. When smokers make an effort to kick away their habit, withdrawal becomes the biggest obstacle for users of cannabis. Symptoms comprising sleep disorders, cravings and mood swings as well as marked distress, are not risky or deadly but can force addicts to reuse the drug, said Prof. Copeland.
