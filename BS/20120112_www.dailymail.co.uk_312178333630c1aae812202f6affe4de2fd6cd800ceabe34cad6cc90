Bored in the office? Research says workers often seek comfort in food, coffee and alcohol Around half said being bored at work might lead them to look for a new job.Dr Mann, of the University of Central Lancashire, said: 'My analysis suggests that the most significant cause of office boredom is an undemanding workload, so managers should look at ways of reducing sources of workplace boredom and encourage better ways of coping.

Internet addiction can be as harmful to teenagers' brains as cocaine and cannabis Service with a smile hides misery of staff left feeling 'exhausted and cynical' 'This could involve enrichment programmes such as job rotation, multi-skilling and empowerment.'Encouraging healthier ways of coping with boredom could include education or providing healthy snacks and drinks in canteens.' People who are bored at work are more likely to have an alcoholic drink at the end of the day, a study saidThe study, among more than 100 office workers, also found that some people are more prone to boredom.The research will be presented to the British Psychological Society's annual occupational psychology conference in Chester today.

It's not only in the workplace that this can happen , many people go down hill after retirement , and turn to comfort eating or alcohol. If you are in this situation find new hobbies and exersise your brain too. - Carole , UK, 12/1/2012 08:44 Click to rate Rating 13 Report abuse 'Multi tasking' is just another way for employers to get two jobs out of one person, I know I'm a civil servant. - Anon, Oxon, England, 12/1/2012 08:14 Click to rate Rating 34 Report abuse I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!! ------------------ I was exactly the same 15 years ago. I left in the end and temped until something else came up. That job was definitely not good for my health. I too had panic attacks on way to work. I used to think, 'if the lights stay green I'll go in. If they turn red I'll go home'. Seems mad now but I was so unhappy. Used to spend Sunday's counting hours til Monday morning. - looby lou, uk, 12/1/2012 07:56 Click to rate Rating 41 Report abuse Too right! Being bored, undervalued, management not wanting you to use your experience of over 25yrs , etc changed my job from being so so rewarding and interesting where one could immerse oneself, into a job that is so boring and totally unrewarding. My job has actually not changed, but procedures within the work area have drastically altered, and not for the better for our customers. A positive workplace can put external problems out of your mind for some of the say. A negative workplace makes external problems grow. This has happened with me. After over 25 yrs of employment, I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!! - lp, uk, 12/1/2012 07:46 Click to rate Rating 43 Report abuse It is a medical condition called "bore out" similar to "burn out".

My job keeps me comfortably busy from 08.30 to 16.30. The work I do is rewarding and I like the people I work with.
