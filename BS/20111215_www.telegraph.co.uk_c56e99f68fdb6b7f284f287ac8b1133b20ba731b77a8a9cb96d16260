Bathroom habits such as leaving the toilet door open were also cited by women taking part in the survey as a frequent failing. The poll of 2,000 women showed more than 75 per cent believed the perfect man did not exist. Other shortcomings were an inability to multi-task, criticising their partner's driving and not getting along with her family. Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington which commissioned the research, said: "It seems that women are actually quite realistic on what they look for from their partner.

The results showed one in five women think their partner only pretends to listen to them while leaving clothes on the bedroom floor and snoring were among other gripes. The perfect man would be expected to make an effort with his partner's friends, avoid using her toothbrush, stay clean-shaven and not be lazy. But above all, 35 per cent of women rate a good personality as most important with sense of humour the top quality for a quarter of respondents. Footballer David Beckham came top in the poll of perfect celebrity man, while chef Gordon Ramsay ranked near the bottom. Miss McReynolds added: "It's clear that while guys may not be completely perfect, there are plenty of things they can be perfect in, in order to please their partner. "As long as guys take the time to look after themselves, be attentive and keep up appearances then their partner will be willing to overlook the smaller pet peeves. "The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, and their partners don't expect them to – but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference." .at15t_email {display:none !important;} ul li.email span.at300bs {display:none !important;} {parsetags: 'explicit'} X Share & bookmark Delicious Facebook Google Messenger Reddit Twitter Digg Fark LinkedIn Google Buzz StumbleUpon Y!
