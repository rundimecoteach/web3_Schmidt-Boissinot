Bed bugs and other parasites such as mosquitoes, midges and ticks prefer relatively smooth areas, such as the wrists and ankles. A bedbug engorged with blood after feeding on a human arm But as the insects search for somewhere to dive in, the nerves in hairs also increase the chances of them being felt on the skin and swatted away. Researchers studied 29 brave volunteers who had one arm shaved before hungry bed bugs were placed on their skin. More... British trainee safari guide killed by bite from a black mamba snake he thought had just brushed his hand Girl, 13, savaged by German shepherd puppy which left her needing 50 stitches (but she still loves dogs) The results of the experiment showed that people with more hair - both longer hairs and fine, almost invisible 'vellus' hairs - were more protected.Hair covering the arms extended each insect’s search for an ideal feeding ground, and increased the likelihood of it being detected. Singer Sir Tom Jones shows off his hairy chest, and so he should, as it protects him from bed bugs Because of this, bed bugs and other parasites including mosquitoes, midges, ticks and leeches prefer relatively hairless areas such as the wrists and ankles, the scientists claim.Study leader Professor Michael Siva-Jothy, from the University of Sheffield’s Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said: 'Our findings show that more body hairs mean better detection of parasites.'The hairs have nerves attached to them and provide us with the ability to detect displacement. By forming a barrier and providing detection, these hairs prolong search time and make detection more likely because the bug has to spend more time clambering over them.'The results have implications for understanding why we look the way we do, what selective forces might have driven us to look the way we do, and may even provide insight for better understanding of how to reduce biting insects’ impact on humans.'The findings may explain why humans have retained a body-covering of fine hair.'Our proposal is that we retain the fine covering because it aids detection and if we lost all hair, even the relatively invisible fine hair, our detection ability goes right down,' said Prof Siva-Jothy. At arms length: Bed bugs are deterred by hairy arms The research is published today in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. Prof Siva-Jothy said it would be wrong to assume women will always be bitten more often than hairier men.He pointed out: 'Men have more body hair than women which is caused by the action of testosterone at puberty. This does not necessarily mean that women are more likely to be bitten. 'Blood-sucking insects are likely to have been selected to prefer to bite hosts in relatively hairless areas.”The Sheffield scientists are investigating the biology, reproduction and immunity of blood-sucking insects.Their aim is to find more effective ways of controlling parasitic insects and the diseases they spread.

I don't know if Marmite works on bed bugs though as I've never met a bed bug in my life. They were pretty well eradicated here back in the 'Forties with the use of DDT but now they are coming back in force owing to the rise in international travel, they hitch a lift in luggage bags or on people's clothing and so they are most often found living in hotels. - Susan, Manchester, 14/12/2011 10:04 Click to rate Rating 4 Report abuse Then why does our extremelly hairy lovely Cavallier King Charles get Ticks attached to him deep in his fur found nine attached after one walk. - Tanya, Gosport, UK, 14/12/2011 09:44 Click to rate Rating 11 Report abuse As a hirsute man, I can assure you that this story has no merit whatsoever.
