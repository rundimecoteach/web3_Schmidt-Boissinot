Instead of booking a hotel room, people will often book an apartment so they have facilities to cook meals for themselves."While people with life-threatening allergies could eat out, they tended to limit such occasions because of the stress involved - particularly in countries with a different language."Whether you're at home or away, it means you need to be more cautious," she said. "You need to disclose the allergy. You need to ask a lot more questions about the food and then you need to gauge the information that you have been given."If a waiter says to you 'That should be OK', you ask for an ingredient list. You need to be a bit assertive and you do that because of safety. Near enough isn't good enough."She said families planning to travel anywhere by plane should directly contact the airline for its policy on carrying medications, including adrenaline auto-injectors.Although there were no allergen-free flights, families could reduce risk by alerting the airline to the allergy, asking about food and snacks served, taking their own food and always carrying their adrenaline pen with them."They should get a doctor's letter and action plan outlining the allergy and confirming the need to carry medication, food, and the pen. Families should also find out what they can about emergency facilities near where they are staying."Many families were reluctant to travel after receiving an allergy diagnosis but it was possible to have a great trip with enough pre-planning, she said.Anaphylaxis Australia could point people to translation organisations which specialised in converting important information into whatever language was required.Whether travelling or at home, parents of highly allergic children were often accused of being neurotic and over-the-top.Relatives who did not understand the seriousness of the allergies could sometimes undermine parents, too."It is really important to not write off the parent of the allergic individual as just being overanxious," Ms Said said."People need to understand this is not a lifestyle choice. This isn't something they have chosen for themselves. Small amounts can trigger life-threatening reactions, and we actually need to know about cross-contamination. We need to see ingredient lists."Between 10 and 20 Australians die from anaphylactic reactions every year, with many of the victims teenagers or young adults. Young people were more at risk because they typically did more things on the hop, socialised more and did not want to draw attention to themselves. Other victims were people who were not under the care of an allergy specialist and who did not have clear strategies in place.Allergies were a community issue."It's not just about the person with the allergy or their families," she said. "It's about relatives, the corner cafe, teachers, the school's camp organiser, the restaurant owner. Everyone needs to understand what they can do to help reduce risk."Much of the training around food allergies within the food services sector remained ad hoc and needed to be improved to ensure all service deliverers understood the risks and how to minimise them."We understand that we can never say that any food is guaranteed to be safe," Ms Said said. "We always need to be prepared for an allergic reaction but there is a lot the food service sector can do to help reduce risk. Part of that is learning how to communicate with the allergic individual and developing strategies in workplaces to reduce risk."Travel tips and plans for those at risk of anaphylaxis can be found at allergyfacts.org.au.
