Toxins that cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) have reached warning levels along the coast from Tairua to the Whakatane Heads, Matakana and Motiti islands. The board says bivalve shellfish, catseyes and kina should not be taken or eaten, while paua, crayfish and crabs should have the guts removed before cooking. The DHB says in severe cases, PSP can cause paralysis and respiratory failure. Monitoring of toxin levels will continue in the affected areas.
