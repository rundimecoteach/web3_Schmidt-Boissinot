If it does, an independent committee will value it and any money raised will be divided equally between Mr Webster and the landowner.The hoard was on show on Wednesday at an event in the museum to mark the launch of the Treasure and Portable Antiquities Scheme reports, which show there were 157,188 finds recorded in 2009 and 2010.Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, said: "It is widely recognised that both the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the Treasure Act 1996 have been a great success."They are both helping to enrich museum collections, with the most important archaeological discoveries being acquired for the nation."It is a tremendous achievement that the Staffordshire and Frome hoards are now on display in public collections where they can be enjoyed by all."
