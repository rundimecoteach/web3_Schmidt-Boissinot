The degree of severity was determined by how many other symptoms they reported, such as a loss of appetite, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.In this study, it was found that 40 per cent of those who had experienced a severe depressive episode did not get treatment for it - which would include therapy, medication or both - 57 per cent reporting a moderate episode were untreated, and it was 82 per cent for those with mild symptoms.The centre called on employers to make treatment options for depression more accessible to their workers."It's not even just about out-of-pocket payments and things like that," Dewa said. "Can people get time off to go to the doctor or to get counselling? Because to get those kinds of treatment, often you have to go during working hours."She highlighted the value in employer-benefits plans that cover drugs and therapy for depression.Dewa said it typically costs an employer about $18,000 if a worker takes a leave of absence due to mental illness, due to the disruption in workflow. While it's unclear what it would cost organizations to improve the accessibility of treatment options - which also could include a communications policy to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness - she said it would be less expensive than having the employee take leave.She added that including mental-health drugs and therapy under the umbrella of universal, publicly funded health care is worth consideration.The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's study follows a report from the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation last month pointing out the drag mental illness has on worker productivity in industrialized countries all over the world, and how it hurts individuals' chances of employment.dabma@postmedia.comTwitter.com/derekabmaÂ© Postmedia News 2012 Ads by Google</p>
