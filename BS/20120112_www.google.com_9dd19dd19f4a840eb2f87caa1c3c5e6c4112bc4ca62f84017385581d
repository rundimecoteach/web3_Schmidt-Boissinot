The firm fitted more of the implants than any other UK cosmetic surgery firm but claims replacing the banned implants would put it out of business. Another private company, Transform, has also said it will not replace the implants free of charge. Other providers including BMI Healthcare, Nuffield Health and Spire have agreed to offer free removal.Around 40,000 British women received PIP implants manufactured by the now closed French company Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). The implants were filled with non-medical grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.The Government has said anxious patients who had their surgery on the NHS will be able to have the implants removed and replaced free of charge. The NHS will also pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses to do so or no longer exists.On Wednesday, Mr Lansley reiterated the Government's view that private clinics have a moral duty to look after their patients. He also announced further investigations into the scandal, including looking at the EU approval of the devices which resulted in them receiving a CE mark. The actions of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK will also be analysed further.Ms Taber welcomed much of Mr Lansley's announcement but said providers were affected by the "MHRA failure to detect the faulty" implants.She added: "Whilst the intention of the Health Secretary was to offer guidance, patients are feeling more confused and anxious now than ever before. With the current Government position remaining unclear, patients want to know the timeline for the further investigations into PIP implants by the MHRA. There is need for clarity on how patients can access scans and ensuring that all GPs are authorised to order scans."She added: "Members of IHAS are as much a victim of this fraud as the NHS and the patients. We all trusted the standards regulator, the MHRA, and the Department of Health."If there is any moral or ethical obligation outstanding it lies with the Government's regulatory agency, the MHRA. But the overriding issue here is that it is in everyone's interest to work together to ensure that patients are treated with compassion." Copyright © 2012 The Press Association. All rights reserved.
