The building, the first phase of which was built in 1906, met with a 5,000-pound wrecking ball Wednesday morning, and the meeting was decidedly one-sided. Bricks, concrete and other materials rained down as the ball smashed the building's roof, eliciting squeals of delight from the students at Mulvey School, who watched from the schoolyard as the building across the street took blow after blow. The old girl did put up a bit of a fight, at one point fraying the supportive cable enough to disconnect the wrecking ball from the crane — something project superintendent George Vincent said isn't uncommon in largescale demos. It's expected to take 35 days for the Maryland South building to be completely demolished and the rubble cleaned up. Over the years, the building has been home to interim care and acute care units, a cafeteria and a chapel, but hospital brass have been planning its replacement for more than two decades. The project is finally being realized as part of a multi-million dollar redevelopment project that will see a new two-storey health complex rise in the Maryland South building's place. The new complex, to be built over the next 18 to 24 months, will house the Buhler Eye Care Centre, an ambulatory diagnostic centre, and a health centre for seniors touted as a "one-stop shop" for everything from rehabilitation to social activities. Phase 2 of the redevelopment plan will see the Sherbrook Building on the other side of the hospital demolished and replaced with a new chapel and front entrance, as well as space for medical programs.

The project's supervisor said that's not an unusual occurrence since the ball is being dragged in and out of jagged holes.
