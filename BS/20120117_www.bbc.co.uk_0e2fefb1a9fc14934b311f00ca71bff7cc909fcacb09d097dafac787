NHS London is cutting the number of trainee nurses from 2,000 to 1,580 a year. The organisation claims the change will allow it to raise standards of teaching. But the RCN warned of the possibility of "chronic shortages" of nurses, with staff poached from abroad. RCN chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: "We are deeply concerned at this reduction in nurse training places. "The nursing workforce has grown in recent years, but only just enough to keep up with rising demands on healthcare. "It is vital to avoid a return to the chronic shortages of the early 1990s and the old boom-and-bust cycle of NHS workforce planning." 'Wasted investment' He continued: "NHS London needs to produce a robust plan guaranteeing continued investment in nurse training and education. "The vast majority of newly qualified nurses are dedicated professionals, who are committed to providing the highest possible standards of patient care. "Having the right numbers and mix of healthcare professionals is pivotal in enabling these nurses to provide this high quality care." Dr Anne Rainsberry of NHS London said: "Figures show that if we continue to train the same number of adult nurses as we currently do, there will soon be more trained nurses than there are jobs available. "This would leave graduates out of work and waste the taxpayers' investment in their training. "By reducing the number of training places for adult nurses next year, we can invest in training more nurses where London really needs them - like increasing the number of health visitors and children's nurses working in the capital."
