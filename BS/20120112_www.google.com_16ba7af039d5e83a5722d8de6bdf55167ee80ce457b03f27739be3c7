But this did not seems to effect the number of people dropping out of the trials, suggesting that, overall, GLP-1 was well tolerated, they said.Vilsboll and colleagues recommended that the hormone be "considered" for obese patients suffering from diabetes, and called for further trials to test its efficacy for obese people who are not diabetic.In a commentary, also in the BMJ, Raj Padwal from the University of Alberta argued that -- despite its weight-reducing powers -- GLP-1 should not alter current medical practice."Modification of diet and lifestyle remain the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes," he said.The hormone's longterm safety is still unknown, he added.
