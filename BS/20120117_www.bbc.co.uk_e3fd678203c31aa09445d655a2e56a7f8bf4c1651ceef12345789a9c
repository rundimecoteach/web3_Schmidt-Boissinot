Luton and Dunstable Hospital introduced the measure to protect patients and public from the norovirus bug. "This condition causes vomiting and diarrhoea," a spokesperson said. The hospital is also asking the public to only to come to A&E if it is a real emergency and to bring only one other person with them. Visitors will be allowed only into wards where a patient is critically ill and these include such places as the intensive care unit. "We expect the ban on visitors to last for 24-48 hours," the spokesperson said. "Patients on five of our wards have been affected and they are closed to new admissions to help avoid the spread of infection. "If members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease please do not come to A&E." The virus has to run it course over two or three days as there is no cure. The hospital advises those stricken with the condition to stay indoors, isolate themselves from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated.
