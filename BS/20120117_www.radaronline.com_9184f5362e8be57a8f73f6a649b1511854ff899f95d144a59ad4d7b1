Trent Arsenault of Freemont, California, who first hit the headlines last year for running an illegal sperm bank, appears on Tuesday's episode of Anderson, and RadarOnline.com has a sneak peak of his bombshell revelation. "I coined this term donor sexual and I'll explain, it means 100 percent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies," Arsneault told host Anderson Cooper.

"I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin, except I'll have 15 plus kids," he explained.

Later in the show, Arsenault came face-to-face with one of his biological children, two-year-old daughter, Analise, for the first time. PHOTOS: Model Moms "It's a thrill," to meet her, he said. "I'm trying to not get too emotional. I’m just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that."
