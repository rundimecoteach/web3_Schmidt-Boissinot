KEPLER Published: January 8, 2012 Sign In to E-Mail Print Reprints Fans of Elton John, below, will have to wait a little longer for his memoir of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll. But his publisher is expected to announce Monday that Mr. John, 64, has signed up to write his first book, about his experience in fighting AIDS. The book, titled “Love Is the Cure,” will be “the very personal stories of Sir Elton’s life during the AIDS epidemic, including his agony at seeing friend after friend perish needlessly,” said his publisher, Little, Brown & Company. Mr. John had long wondered why greater effort was not made to cure the disease. “Why are we not doing more?” he wrote in an e-mail from his publisher. “This is a question I have thought deeply about, and wish to answer — and to help change — by writing this book.” Mr. John, a longtime AIDS activist, founded the Elton John Aids Foundation in 1992. Michael Pietsch, the publisher of Little, Brown, will edit the book, to be released in July. A number of musicians, including Keith Richards, Patti Smith, Pete Townshend and Sammy Hagar, have lined up in recent years to write memoirs. Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer who represented Mr. John in the deal, said that Mr. John had no such plans. A version of this brief appeared in print on January 9, 2012, on page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Publisher Has Deal For Elton John Book.
