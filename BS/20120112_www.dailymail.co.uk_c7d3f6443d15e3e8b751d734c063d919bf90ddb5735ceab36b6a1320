The group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted PIP implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010. This is around one in three of the 45,000 sold. Mr Braham said the business did not have the money, time or space to remove and replace all the implants – and the NHS should step in. Booming business: The group fitted PIP implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010 He said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility. More... 'How the hell has this happened?' TOWIE's Lauren Pope reveals shock after discovering she has PIP breast implants His comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits.They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles. AGONY OF MUM-TO-BE When Anntina Maughan had her breasts enlarged, she was thrilled with the results.Now, four years later and pregnant, the mother of two couldn't be more unhappy with them. Scans show that one – or both – of the PIP implants have ruptured. But, at five-and-a-half-months pregnant, Miss Maughan, 39, of Crawley in West Sussex, has been advised against surgery to have them out.Miss Maughan paid Harley Medical Group £5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self-esteem due to her small bust. Last year she started experiencing burning pains, and then found lumps in her breasts, raising fears of cancer. She now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant. Miss Maughan believes the Harley Medical Group should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby. She added: 'It is their fault this happened. I went there in full confidence. If it was up to me, I'd have the implants out right now. I worry because I don't know what was in them.' Mr Lansley also pointed the finger at Germany, by naming it as the country that approved the French-made PIPs for use in Europe.Industry experts say that the combination of cut-price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using PIPs to make an extra profit of up to £1,000 per patient. Tests have confirmed that PIP implants, which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial-grade silicone believed to have been made for mattresses, do not cause cancer. However, the Department of Health admits they should never have been put in the human body and the Health Secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to have it done.Last Friday, Mr Lansley said private clinics have a ‘moral duty’ to take them out and if they don’t, the NHS will step in. However, the pledge doesn’t include the replacement of implants.Many private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but two of the largest groups have ignored Mr Lansley’s call.Transform, Britain’s biggest cosmetic surgery group, is ‘reviewing its options’. But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to replace PIP implants. The Harley Medical Group has so far removed and replaced ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past two years.Mr Braham, who previously ran a travel agency in Australasia, said his business couldn’t cope with the panic from its patients. He said: ‘We don’t have the number of surgeons, the hospitals and the anaesthetists and we don’t have the financial capacity to do it for nothing.‘We do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of adding another 13,900 on top of that.’ Instead, he wants the NHS to take the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the operating table.Mr Braham wants the Health Service to pay for the bulk of the costs. The firm would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the Government. The Government however said it would be ‘irresponsible’ of the Harley Medical Group not to help its patients.Fazel Fatah, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We find it outrageous…when women’s peace of mind is at stake, some clinics are refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care, particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and resources.’ Dutch authorities have reversed their earlier advice on PIPs and said women who had the implants should have them removed.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all Surely this will make any future clients run a mile before entering this clinic? Should these women also worry about what they have been injecting in their faces too, especially all the trout pout women on tv these days??? - poppy, gateshead, 12/1/2012 12:34 Click to rate Rating 12 Report abuse When you buy goods or services they must be "fit for purpose". Therefore if these are not then under the Sale of Goods and Services Act the supplier is responsible to put right or refund - if a refund is made on the cost then that money should go to the NHS if they put things right! The taxpayer should NOT, except where the work was originally carried out by the NHS, have to foot the bill! - Albert, Sick and stuck in the UK, 12/1/2012 12:11 Click to rate Rating 25 Report abuse so if there was no NHS to fall back on what would happen could you afford to sue them or would they just go out of business .this is the all singing all dancing private medical care we are running headlong into,we have seen what happens in the private care home industry,no profit no service. - alan, essex, 12/1/2012 12:09 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse And the tax payer can't afford to correct their mistakes either. They took the profit they should fix the problem. - Ken, Essex, 12/1/2012 11:52 Click to rate Rating 28 Report abuse Anybody who has any procedures booked at these clinics should cancel them now until the clinic accepts its responsibility and does the right thing by replacing the implants. They made enough money out of putting them in so they can bear the brunt. They must have insurance surely. - Liz M, London, 12/1/2012 11:41 Click to rate Rating 26 Report abuse Revoke the license, ban the directors from opening up substitute companies these companies have an obligation to their their clients, taxpayers should not pick up their costs - Jos, London, 12/1/2012 11:21 Click to rate Rating 28 Report abuse What a complete joke!!! the health n safety rules only apply when it is costing honest hard working people....who is responsible for this total mess up of health n safety needs shooting!! Huge profits have been made in this growing industry and now they need to give it back, they dont want to play ball. I would say they have killed their own golden goose now... - Fed Up, Leeds, 12/1/2012 11:17 Click to rate Rating 19 Report abuse Interesting isn't it that whilst the French health service have offered to take these implants out, the British goverment have said they will only consent to the removal if your private clinic refuses to carry out the op. What happens about the reconstruction I wonder? Good move by BMI to offer. Their positive attitude has bought them effectively thousands of pounds worth of free advertising and makes them look like they care.; effectively BMI's stance forced the government to take the default position and do something about the PIP implants. . - Heartbeatuk, Surrey, 12/1/2012 11:08 Click to rate Rating 3 Report abuse Yet again private business takes the profits when things are going well but expects the public sector to pick up the bill when things go wrong. THIS IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NHS!! The Harley Medical Group is clearly not fit for purpose and should be closed down as a matter of urgency. Its assets (including the homes of its directors) should be sold to cover some of the cost of rectifying their incompetence. - Robert, Manchester, 12/1/2012 10:54 Click to rate Rating 40 Report abuse What they really mean is "it will cut into our profits, so we'll let the NHS cope with problems" That is what happens with MOST private health-care facilities in the UK, who will not do ANY medical procedures that do not make them a profit_ the difficult cases are ALL referred on to NHS facilities. - Cooper, cambridge, 12/1/2012 10:53 Click to rate Rating 25 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
