The reports, which cover the six months between April and September last year, show there were 55 deaths and 68 incidents of “severe harm” to patients in health boards and NHS trusts in Wales from such incidents. In some parts of the NHS the number of deaths and incidents of severe harm have risen steeply in the last six months. Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, has called on Health Minister Lesley Griffiths to investigate relatively high death rates in some health boards. According to reports submitted to the National Patient Safety Agency, more than 40 patients have died in patient safety incidents at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in the course of 18 months and there were almost 30 deaths at both Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board and Hywel Dda Health Board, in the same period. An investigation was launched into a reported 41 deaths at Aneurin Bevan Health Board between April and September and it resulted in the figure being revised to 18. Ms Williams said: “It is accepted that some patients will die in hospitals, but it is unacceptable that patients die due to hospital error. “In the last two years, more than 40 patients have died unnecessarily under the care of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. Surely that statistic is alarming enough to warrant an investigation? “If the health boards can learn from their mistakes, they can reduce the number of people who die needlessly in our NHS. “Patient safety and welfare is paramount, which is why I have written to the Health Minister demanding that she looks into this issue with a matter of urgency. This is clearly a systematic problem that the Labour Government needs to address.” The figures also raise concerns about whether health boards are reporting all incidents as Powys Local Health Board said there had been just one between April and September last year. But in the previous six months, the health board had reported 264 incidents, including one which resulted in the death of a patient. A spokesman for Powys Local Health Board said: “There has clearly been an error in the data published. We are looking into the process of preparing and uploading this data to identify the error. Once this is complete we will ensure that the report is corrected as soon as possible.” Overall, the April to September 2011 figures show there were 26,749 reported incidents, a 9% drop on the previous six-month period. The vast majority of these incidents – 91% – resulted in no or “low” harm to a patient. A Welsh Government spokesman said: “Every year, thousands of patients receive high quality, safe and effective treatment, but in a modern health system – where increasingly complicated procedures are being undertaken – sadly, mistakes can, and will, still happen. “When this happens, the NHS must investigate and take action, where appropriate, and provide assurances and feedback to patients. “As the figures show, the overwhelming majority of incidents result in no harm to patients. It is important every incident, no matter how small or serious, is reported to ensure they can be investigated and measures put in place to reduce the risk of them happening again. “We encourage high reporting as this provides organisations with more opportunities to learn from incidents and improve safety. “We know from research that high reporting is a positive indicator of an open and supportive safety culture. “The 1,000 Lives campaign saved an additional 1,199 lives in Welsh healthcare and staff continue to deliver major improvements on critical care wards, in operating theatres and in the community, including the reduction of pressure ulcers and healthcare associated infections.” Related Tags 1000 lives plus, deaths, nhs, patient safety (What's this) Related Stories NHS Wales chief executive David Sissling sets out five challenges facing the service in 2012 Jan 9 2012 Blind and deaf are ‘forgotten’ by NHS, report reveals Jan 9 2012 Blind patient discusses difficulties of accessing NHS services Jan 9 2012 Seventy-two million and rising - what happens to your prescription?
