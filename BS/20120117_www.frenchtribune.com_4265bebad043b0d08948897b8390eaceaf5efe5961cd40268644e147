The study was taken out at the University of California, where they discovered a compound known as hovenia which was extracted from the Chinese Raisin Tree. This compound is said to stop alcohol hangovers as well as reduce the alcohol dependency. One of the study researchers, Jing Liang, said that this cure used to be adopted by Chinese people about 500 years ago for the same measure. So, they cannot affirm that it is the first discovery. It was there in the history but was with passage of time, its use was forgotten. In order to reach at above conclusion, they conducted an experiment on rats where they found that the compound neutralizes the intoxication effect and inhibits alcohol dependency. It was also found to reduce alcohol consumption in rodents, said Liang. He further affirmed, “It’s basic research, but what I found interesting is it’s building on an old medication that is coming from Chinese medicine and they have been able to identify within this preparation a compound that seems to clear alcohol”. The study team is hoping to develop a drug using this compound which is remedy for both the treatments hangover and alcoholism. If they would be able to create such drug then they hope to save more than 76 million lives across the globe which suffers from one or the other alcohol use disorder. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) has affirmed that alcohol related deaths have increased worldwide and 2.5 million people die every year due to it. So it is hoped that this remedy would help people from potential danger.
