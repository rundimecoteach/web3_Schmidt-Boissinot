DEMOLITION work began Wednesday at the Misericordia Health Complex, the start of a $43-million development. A 2,272-kilogram wrecking ball was used to cave in the roof of a 106-year-old building, the Maryland South building. The redevelopment will take place in two phases. Phase one involves replacing the demolished Maryland South building with a two-storey complex that will accommodate the Buhler Eye Centre -- the largest facility of its kind in Western Canada -- and the new University of Manitoba Ophthalmology residency program. The complex's ambulatory diagnostic centre will relocate from the fourth floor to be closer to Urgent Care and Ambulatory Care. The new complex will house PRIME, a new day health centre for the elderly. Work in the first phase is expected to be completed in 2013. The second phase of the redevelopment will include demolition of the Sherbrook building and replacing it with a new chapel and spacious front entrance and two-storey glass-walled atrium Wednesday's demolition was unexpectedly interrupted when the wrecking ball became wedged in the upper floors of the structure and came loose. Hospital officials said the wrecking ball was reattached and demolition crews were back to work by noon. George Vincent, project superintendent, said it will take about seven weeks to completely demolish the building and clean up the site.
