The benefit was offset by a 30% increase in the risk of life-threatening or debilitating internal bleeding events.For every 120 people treated with aspirin for around six years, one cardiovascular event was averted. But over the same period, one in 73 people suffered from potentially significant bleeding.Lead researcher Dr Rao Seshasai, from St George's, University of London, said: "The beneficial effect of aspirin on preventing future cardiovascular disease events in people with established heart attacks or strokes is indisputable. We urge people with these conditions not to discontinue their medication unless advised to do so by their physicians for valid reasons."However, the benefits of aspirin in those individuals not known to have these conditions are far more modest than previously believed and, in fact, aspirin treatment may potentially result in considerable harm due to major bleeding."
