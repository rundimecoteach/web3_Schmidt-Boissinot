Faulty: Major clinics fitted the cut price PIP implants, pictured, to make more money, but now they are trying to deflect blame onto the Government A fourth group, Linia, says it will remove implants ‘where appropriate’. The company accused the Government of dodging its responsibilities and added that any care it gave will be better than that provided by the NHS, which it said might botch the operations. Together, the four businesses account for 60 per cent of the 50,000 PIP implants used in Britain.With the NHS pledging to step in when private firms refuse to co-operate, the stance taken by the ‘big four’ could cost the taxpayer millions. More... NHS hospital where half of PIP breast implants burst (that's 26 times the official rupture rate) It is estimated that if the NHS funded the removal of all 50,000 implants, the total bill would reach £150million. Even paying for a third of them would cost £50million – the amount the clinics are estimated to have made by choosing the cut-price PIP implants over better-quality ones.On Friday, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said any woman who had breast implants on the NHS would have the right to have them taken out for nothing. The advice stands even if the implants have not ruptured because many women, who will mainly be breast cancer patients, are anxious their health could be at risk. Promise: Andrew Lansley has said that any woman who had the implants on the NHS would be entitled to have them removed for nothing Mr Lansley said private clinics had a ‘moral responsibility’ to produce the same standard of service, but if they refuse to co-operate, the NHS will step in.While he did not order a mass recall, this statement effectively gave the green light for all those who want them removed to have it done. Several large private chains, including Nuffield, Spire Healthcare and BMI, have agreed to comply.But others are resisting, saying the fault lies with the Government and its medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency, for allowing the implants to be sold in the UK.Transform, which sold PIP implants to almost 4,300 patients, is ‘reviewing its options’. But as it stands, it is charging patients £2,800 to have them taken out and better-quality ones put in. It has said that doing the operations for free would put it out of business.Chief executive Nigel Robertson said: ‘If this catastrophic situation was our fault, we would deserve to go out of business and I would hold my hands up. This is a catastrophic failure of the regulator.’ The Harley Medical Group fitted 13,900 PIP implants and says it had a rupture rate of 1.8 per cent. Chairman Mel Braham says he will pay for the cost of new implants, but only if the NHS does the surgery. He said the Government was responsible for the situation and could do the operations because it had hospitals ‘at its fingertips’.The Hospital Group says there is no evidence to suggest routine removal of the implants. Its website points worried patients towards a helpline, which is open only during office hours. Outrageous: Nigel Mercer attacked Linia for their comments and said that patients would soon assume clinics were putting profits ahead of their safety Linia, which fitted 1,540 PIP implants at clinics from Chester to Bristol, is removing implants for free ‘when appropriate’ and replacing them ‘on a case-by-case basis’. It has accused the Government of a massive regulatory failure and claimed that any operations done on the NHS are likely to be performed ‘inadequately’ by trainee surgeons. A spokesman added: ‘We demand… all NHS patients are operated on by the consultants and these consultants should perform these operations outside their normal working hours for which they get paid, as we feel it is their moral obligation.’ Nigel Mercer, past president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the clinics pointing the finger at the MHRA had ‘bought cheap implants and used cheap surgeons for more profit’.He described Linia’s comments as ‘outrageous’ and warned that if clinics don’t start offering free operations, patients will assume they were putting profits before patient care. Mr Mercer added: ‘These companies have huge legal resources and they have used them in the past. ‘They can go after their own insurers and those of PIP to recoup some of the money but they need to sort their act out.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The Government really needs to step up the pressure on these clinics and name and shame. It's not acceptable for women to have products inside them which are not fit for purpose and potentially toxic. Furthermore it's not an adequate response to request that they wait around for the timebomb to rupture before taking any action. The government should be pushing these negligent clinics for immediate preventative action to benefit both the affected women and NHS who will no doubt have to clean up the mess in the future. - anon, uk, 10/1/2012 11:52 Click to rate Rating 5 Report abuse I was meant to say that, LINIA Should provide the proper ahtercare that its patients are entitled too...

Or is this what they want? Then the stretched NHS via the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill. And then they can start up another business under another name! - Julie, Shrewsbury, 09/1/2012 20:58 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse SUE THEM GOVERMENT AND STRIKE THEM OFF - James Bushy, Oxfordshire, 09/1/2012 20:02 Click to rate Rating 7 Report abuse The NHS is already being asked by patients to remove these implants because the private clinics won't pay. It is happening now! Anxious women won't wait while the companies are sued. This shouldn't be happening. The clinics MUST pay. The government needs to step up to the mark on this otherwise it is going to cost the NHS millions! - Julie, Shrewsbury, 09/1/2012 19:17 Click to rate Rating 13 Report abuse SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. My point is that this has nothing to do with the NHS. These clinics should replace them where necessary - roo, London, 09/1/2012 17:55 Click to rate Rating 17 Report abuse Really Roo? Significantly cheaper? - Me, UK, 09/1/2012 17:21 Click to rate Rating 2 Report abuse I work in the private surgical and non surgical industry and am aware of the company that supplied PIP implants initially. These implants were 'significantly' cheaper than all other implants and I am sure than quite a few clinics/surgeons did not pass on that discount to the patient. I also know that all implants have a shelf life and most patients are advised that they will probably need replacing at around 12-15 years anyway. I am afraid I am of the opinion that if you can afford this kind of surgery to begin with and you are no doubt aware that another op will be required in the furture, then you can afford to have them re-done yourself if you feel you are worried. Otherwise a sensible course of action woudl be to stick to having them scanned regularly to make sure they don't rupture. If they are causing problems then the clinic should replace free of charge regarding. This should have absolutely NOTHING to do with the NHS. - Roo, London, 09/1/2012 17:05 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
