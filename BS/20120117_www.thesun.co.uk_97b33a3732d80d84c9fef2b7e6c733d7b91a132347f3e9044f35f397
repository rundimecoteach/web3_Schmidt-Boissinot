Forever Youth Liberator Haven't we heard this somewhere before? WITH an insatiable demand for a wonder product that can recapture a youthful look, some facial lotions and potions can turn into massive sellers. Here is what happened when three products suddenly became the magic formula of the moment. Flavour of the month ... Bottom Butter Sales of Waitrose Baby Bottom Butter doubled to 30,000 tubs in 2008 as mums started using it on their faces. In 2011 it was the supermarket's top skincare line. Big hit ...

Forever Youth Liberator from Yves Saint Laurent had already racked up more than 5,000 pre-orders. In a trial of 50 women, nine out of ten said their skin looked more luminous after using the lotion, while 72 per cent said fine lines were less visible. The range contains synthetic versions of glycans, naturally occurring sugars in the skin. Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry says: "Glycobiology is going to change the world in many areas and it is a very important development in skincare too. "Glycans are complicated sugars that play a key role in the structure of the skin. "They also sit on the surface of cells and transmit messages to them. Glycans reduce with age. These glycans can make skin cells act as they would have when in a younger body." A study of the technique in the journal Technology Review in 2003 said the discovery was "one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the world." YSL worked with Professor Peter Seeberger, of Germany's Max Planck Institute, to develop the serum. He said: "I was surprised YSL was interested in my work. I'm interested in health, not face paint. Still, we were able to apply our existing techniques to glycans in skin." But the search for eternal youth is not cheap. Just 30g — just more than two tablespoons of the serum — is Ј50. Skincare wonder products are not new — and often cheaper. Recent examples include Boots' No7 Protect & Perfect Beauty Serum, which enjoyed a sales boost after being featured in a 2007 BBC documentary. And in April 2008 there was a stampede to supermarket shelves as Waitrose's Baby Bottom Butter sold like hot cakes after parents recommended using the Ј2.54 cream on their faces too. Another cheap skin product which took the beauty world by surprise was supermarket Aldi's Ј3.49 Lacura Multi-Intensive Serum. The Sun checked out what 30g of other luxury goods would cost you: 30g of sterling silver costs Ј17.34, 28g of Mottra Sterlet Sturgeon Caviar is Ј55 from online supermarket Ocado and 30g of Fresh Black Winter Truffle is Ј63.95 from London Fine Foods Group. n.watkins@the-sun.co.uk Back to top of page Today's Discussion Sickening safari: Appalled by tourists who pay to hunt giraffes?
