The Ministry says, the cases should be called 'Extensively Drug Resistant-TB' (XDR-TB) and not 'Totally Drug Resistant TB' (TDR-TB) as per WHO norms, an official release said. The central team has started analysis of the situation and is in touch with the health authorities of Maharashtra, Mumbai Municipal Corporation, while also involving experts from concerned stake-holders, including the Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. Hinduja hospital is not accredited to diagnose XDR or TDR, the release said. "So far as the report from Hinduja Hospital is concerned, this Hospital Laboratory is not accredited by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, for culture and sensitivity for second line drugs to diagnose Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR)/Totally Drug Resistant (TDR) cases and is only accredited for conducting Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) by liquid culture and sensitivity for first line drug only," it said. Recently, a proposal for accreditation of Line Probe Assay test (LPA) has been received and is under process, it added. As of now, the Revised National TB Control Programme has accredited only following three labs for conducting quality-assured second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility testing of flouroquinolones and injectables: National TB Institute (NTI), Bangalore; LRS Institute of TB and Chest Disease, New Delhi, and National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai.
