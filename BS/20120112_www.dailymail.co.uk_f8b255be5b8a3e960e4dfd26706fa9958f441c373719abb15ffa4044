Cabazitaxel increases survival for men who had already tried a range of other therapies.Each year around 35,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer, with around 10,000 having locally advanced disease who might be eligible for the drug.But the NHS rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, says it is not value for money despite admitting it works. An electron micrograph of prostatic cancer cells. A new drug prolonging life for prostate cancer sufferers has been rejected by the NHS rationing body In draft guidance issued today Nice says the drug is not cost-effective, even though it was fast-tracked in the US as a ‘last chance’ treatment for prostate cancer sufferers.The drug made by Sanofi costs around £22,000 for a one-off course of treatment.The Prostate Cancer Charity said men in England would have to apply to the Cancer Drugs Fund in a bid to get it, but the option was not open to men in Wales which does not have a similar fund.Owen Sharp, chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity, said ‘This decision is a huge blow to men living with the very advanced stages of prostate cancer who currently have very limited treatment options open to them.

Results from a clinical trial of 755 men from 26 countries found the drug had benefits in patients whose cancer continued to progress despite the use of the current final option, the chemotherapy drug Taxotere.Men whose cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland are usually treated with drugs that reduce the body’s production of testosterone, a hormone that can feed cancer growth.When such therapy fails, Taxotere is used but this often fails as well.The trial showed the overall survival of men taking cabazitaxel was 15.1 months compared with 12.7 months for men taking the drug mitoxantrone, used to promote quality of life.Other information considered by Nice concluded men gained an average of three months’ extra life. Owen Sharp, from the Prostate Cancer Charity, said the news is a 'huge blow' for those in the advanced stage of the disease The US drugs watchdog, the Food and Drugs Administration, considered cabazitaxel, also known as Jevtana, under its priority review programme for drugs that may offer a major advance in treatment and approved it in 2010.Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of Nice said ‘Although cabazitaxel has been shown to be effective in extending life, it is also associated with a number of side effects.‘Once these factors had been taken into account, the independent Committee appraising this drug concluded that it would not provide enough health benefit to justify its cost, which means it would not be a cost effective use of limited NHS resources.‘The draft guidance on cabazitaxel is now with consultees, who have the opportunity to appeal against it. Until NICE issues final guidance, NHS bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments. ‘This draft guidance does not mean that people currently taking cabazitaxel will stop receiving it. They have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop.’ Dr Jasmin Hussein, oncology medical manager of Sanofi, said ‘We are disappointed that Nice has not recommended the use of Jevtana on the basis of cost. It offers an important new treatment option with significant clinical benefit.‘There is significant clinical need within the NHS for Jevtana – with around 100 patients having been prescribed the drug through the Cancer Drugs Fund.’ Share this article: Facebook Twitter Google+ Messenger LinkedIn Digg it Newsvine Fark Nowpublic Reddit Print article Email article Add your comments Comments (26) Here's what other readers have said.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all Let's be clear - this is not a cure. If this drug were able to cure the cancer then I am sure it would be found to be good value. But at a cost of over £7000 per month for the extra 3 months it provides? I can see why Nice have felt the need to make this decision. What good is an extra 3 months to most people. This includes my father, who has the time of cancer they describe, currently controlled by hormone treatment, and who when the time comes will, I am sure, move on to the next line of treatment if the benefits outweigh the side-effects, but he would not wish to deprive the country of £22k for a mere 3 months at the end of his life. A cure would be a different matter entirely. - Mother of 4, Guildford, 12/1/2012 13:20 Click to rate Rating 2 Report abuse The National Health Service is NOT the National Immortality Service.

Go into any surgery and check out the posters on the walls. Can you find one which deals with male issues? Go into a hospital. Can you find a male nurse? Ask at your local surgery for a blood test. See how they will um and ah about it. Then send your wife in a few days later and see how they will immediately give her an appointment. I hope I live long enough to see the worm turn.

The average is 3 months meaning that some will live longer and presumably during the trial the worst affected would have been treated and if now considered safe and given earlier we will see longer survival rates. NICE must go. - malc, essex, 12/1/2012 11:32 Click to rate Rating 5 Report abuse three months extra wont make it better just prolong the agony of knowing youre soon to pass. they should be issuing drugs to make it quicker not slower - Dave, Gloucester, 12/1/2012 11:23 Click to rate Rating 6 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
