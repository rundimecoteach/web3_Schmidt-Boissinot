"The solution is to postpone the disclosure of medically irrelevant information to women until after about 30 weeks of pregnancy."Dr. Nahid Azad, president of the Federation of Medical Women of Canada, said if the problem is widespread the blanket policy is an effective way to combat feticide, but she added the Canadian Medical Association should undertake a study to determine where the practice is most prevalent in Canada."I cannot see only one organization or one specific policy would be able to tackle that," she said. "If it's widespread, if it's a growing problem, then we do need to have some kind of blanket type policy for everyone. If there are pockets [where it happens], and there are particularly some provinces [where] this is being practised, or there is good documentation or understanding, that requires a much higher level of scrutiny."Dr. Shelly Ross, an obstetrician and international liaison for the FMWC, said it is not likely the policy would have any effect on the practice of feticide. "The rules, at least in B.C., are that we don't tell them for 20 weeks," Ross said. "But I find that in this modern day and age, if we say, 'No, we're not going to tell you,' [the patients] will go out to the private [doc-tor] and find out themselves."Ross stressed the organization is wholly against feticide, but she doesn't feel extending the current time frame for keeping the gender secret would make any difference.In an interview, Kale said 30 weeks was picked as an approximate time to start providing mothers information on their fetus's sex because, after that point, it would be difficult for anyone to get an abortion with-out a good medical reason for doing so.Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver SunÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed Â Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:**** Â Â Â Â Â Â Related Topics Shelly RossCanadian Medical AssociationCanada .textheadlines-links ul.list_vr_line li a { margin-left:3px; font-size:12px; font-weight:bold; color:#004276; } .outbrain_rec_li { color: #9A9A9A; font: 11px arial,Helvetica,Utkal,sans-serif; list-style: none outside none !important; font-weight:normal; padding: 0px 0px 8px 0px !important; } #outbrain_widget_0 a:link, #outbrain_widget_1 a:link, #outbrain_widget_0 a:visited, #outbrain_widget_1 a:visited { color: #004276; outline: medium none; font-weight:bold;} .div-wrapper ul { padding: 0 0 0 0px !important;} span.rec-src-link { font-weight:bold; } .outbrain_strybtmmorebx h4 { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 21px; padding-bottom: 8px; } .Outbrain_recommendations_legend {display:none;} .outbrain-recommendationsFieldset { border-width:0px !important; padding:0px !important ;} .ob_dual_right { width:100% !important;} #outbrain_widget_0 .AR_1 .ob_dual_left, #outbrain_widget_0 .AR_1 .ob_dual_right { display: block; float: none; margin-top: 0!important; padding-top: 0!important; width: 100%; !important;} #outbrain_widget_0 { padding: 0px 0px 0px 4px !important;} #outbrain_widget_1 { padding: 0px 0px 0px 4px !important;} .AR_1 .ob_dual_right .odb_li .ob-text-content .ob_source { color: #9A9A9A !important;font-size: 12px;} .ob_what a {color: #9A9A9A !important; font-size:10px; font-weight:normal;} .ob_dual_left { width: 100% !important;} .AR_1 .ob_dual_left, .AR_1 .ob_dual_right { width: 100% !important;}</p>
