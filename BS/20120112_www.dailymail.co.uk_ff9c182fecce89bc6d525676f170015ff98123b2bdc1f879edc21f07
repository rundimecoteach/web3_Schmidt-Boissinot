More... 'Cuddle hormone' which makes mothers kinder could help treat autism The charity says the MHRA could provide an exemption to the regulations to allow schools across the UK to supply the inhalers.Similar exemptions already exist for organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and the armed forces.Stephen McPartland, Conservative MP for Stevenage, said: 'The tragic case of Stockport schoolboy Samuel Linton, who died in 2007 following an asthma attack at school, shows that there is a real lack of understanding and awareness as to what to do if a child has an asthma attack whilst they are at school.'This is why this campaign is so crucial, not only in terms of giving teachers access to an emergency inhaler but also empowering them with understanding, awareness and support in how to deal with asthma at school.'Dr Kevin Gruffydd Jones, from the Primary Care Respiratory Society (PCRS-UK), said: 'Asthma attacks are serious and children need access to inhalers as soon as possible.'Introducing a spare inhaler for emergencies could prevent a serious asthma attack by getting prompt help for a child when it's needed.'A spokesman for the MHRA said: 'In the interests of patient safety, asthma inhalers should only be supplied on prescription to the individual named, for his or her own use.'The MHRA has no plans to change the current legal position.'Exemptions exist because of the nature of the conditions in which these organisations operate. For example, the conditions in which military operations are undertaken will tend to mean that access to medical care or advice may not be readily available.'Sam Linton's parents, Paul and Karen Linton, said: 'Sam was a wonderful son and his loss has been devastating. The past few years have been horrendous, especially in the knowledge that things could, and should, have been different.'The thought that his death may have been prevented with better training and clearer policies is too much to bear.'Our family has suffered enormously since Sam's death and we know our lives will never be the same again.'We only hope that serious lessons have been learned by all schools so that no one else has to suffer what we have been through so that our son's death is not in vain.'Jonathan Betts, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represents the Linton family, said: 'If left untreated, asthma attacks can have devastating consequences.'A simple national policy would help, which instructs teachers to call an ambulance if a child suffers an asthma attack and is not showing signs of improvement within five to 10 minutes.'If easing the restrictions on schools stocking spare inhalers helps prevent further tragedy in future then we wholeheartedly support it.'

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all My 9yr old started school in 2006 and has always had a named inhaler with a clear prescription label kept in the school office, along with a spacer device and a medical form completed by me. This has allowed her to have supervised inhaler doses whilst at infant school with minimal fuss. The schools in question are supportive and helpful. Reading this article makes me appreciate their efforts and their policies even more. - Claire, Norwich, Norfolk, 12/1/2012 13:52 Click to rate Rating (0) Report abuse Magpieranger, Newcastleshire,12/1/2012 13:35-----------It's people like you who come out with disgusting comments who make children's lives a misery. Grow up! - Anna, Cheshire, 12/1/2012 13:48 Click to rate Rating 1 Report abuse I think asthma is the least of the worries for the kid in the picture. - Magpieranger, Newcastleshire, 12/1/2012 13:35 Click to rate Rating 11 Report abuse These are the lives that are lost due to the 'elf and safety' zealots. It's all well and good trying to minimise risk but when you look at the bigger picture what you have actually done is minimise one risk slightly but increased another risk massively. You can't eliminate all risk from life, just unecessary risk. - Mark, Hartlepool, 12/1/2012 13:29 Click to rate Rating (0) Report abuse I'm going to stop sending my daughter in case learning hurts her brain - Fletch, Dunmow, 12/1/2012 13:19 Click to rate Rating 3 Report abuse I am a teacher. Legally I am not qualified to administer medication to a child but when I take children on field trips I wouldn't dream of not having a blue inhaler in my first aid kit. Side effects from ventolin are extremely rare, while deaths of teenagers from asthma are sadly not so rare. If there is time of course I would leave it to the paramedics, but if an ambulance could not get to us in time I'd far rather risk professional or legal consequences than watch a child die. Usually an asthmatic child carries an inhaler with them, but teenagers being what they are I'd rather be safe than sorry, especially if we happen to be halfway up a mountain or miles from anywhere. - Emma, London, 12/1/2012 13:12 Click to rate Rating 18 Report abuse In most of the schools I know the children have their inhaler kept either by the teacher in a locked desk or in a locked cupboard in the office. Spares are named and kept in the office for safety, but the school cannot keep spare prescription medication un-named "just in case a child does not have his inhaler that day". It is up to the parent to ensure a named spare is kept at school. It is NOT the school's job. The result of a child being given unsuitable medication by a supply teacher or temporary lunchtime supervisor is an horrendous thought. - Cooper, cambridge, 12/1/2012 13:11 Click to rate Rating 7 Report abuse A simple pouch attatched to a belt with the inhaler in it is all that mum has to supply, like the holiday bum bag. And yes I do suffer from Asthmamyself. - me, here, herts, 12/1/2012 12:47 Click to rate Rating 9 Report abuse If their attitude to asthmatics is the same as to diabetics, then god help those kids. Anyway, the fact that there are 1,100 deaths a year is surely enough to prompt a rethink on this issue. How about a school nurse on the premises? Too simple? Probably. - Terence, Norfolk, 12/1/2012 12:38 Click to rate Rating 11 Report abuse what ever happened to the school nurse a lot of children would not be sent home is there was a qualified nurse at the school to give the children their medication they need when they need it. - margaret , oldham uk, 12/1/2012 12:38 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
