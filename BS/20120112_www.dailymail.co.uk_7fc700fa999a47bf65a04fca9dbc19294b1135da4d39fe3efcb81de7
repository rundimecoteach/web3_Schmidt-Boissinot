Dr Ubani said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany.Almost a third of all doctors working within the UK - some 88,000 - are foreign-trained with around 22,758 of those coming from within the European Union.

Europe's war on British justice: UK loses three out of four human rights cases, damning report reveals Surgeons 'reach peak performance between 35 and 50' (... but how do you check once you're on the operating table?) In a joint letter to the Daily Telegraph, Dr Williams and Dr Thompson wrote:'The language competency of doctors from the EU working in Britain, and the stifling effect of the European Working Time Directive on the time that trainee doctors have to learn on the job need urgent action.'EU laws that apply to all sectors can have unintended consequences in health care that can put patients at risk, whether in Britain or other member states.' Demanding action: Prof Norman Williams, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons (left), and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians (right), say EU laws are endangering the lives of NHS patients Currently, British health regulators are not automatically warned when a doctor is struck off the medical register in another country.Yesterday, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he was already taking action to crack down on doctors with a poor grasp of English from practising within the heath service.He said: 'We agree that for too long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to operate in the UK.'That's why I announced last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who can't speak English properly.Mr Lansley has pledged to revise the European Working Time Directive law, which limits doctors to working no more than 48 hours a week, and which he claims hinders the NHS's ability to train its staff.According to the Royal College of Surgeons around 400,000 surgical hours are lost annually as a result of the directive.By October next year, Britain will be required to offer treatment to patients from the EU under the recently introduced 'cross-border health care' directive.GERMAN LOCUM WHO KILLED PENSIONER WITH LETHAL INJECTION ON FIRST SHIFT IN UK SPOKE POOR ENGLISH David Gray, who was given a fatal overdose by Dr Daniel Ubani Pensioner David Gray was suffering from renal colic when he was visited by German locum Dr Daniel Ubani at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, on February 16, 2008.Soon after, he was dead.Speaking poor English and confused about the types of drugs used in the UK, Ubani had administered ten times the normal dose of the painkiller diamorphine to the 7o-year-old.A coroner ruled the death 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and described Ubani as incompetent. He said the government must issue guidance to NHS trusts over checking the backgrounds of doctors and their grasp of the English language.Ubani, originally from Nigeria, was struck off the medical register in the UK. He was later fined £6,000 by medical authorities in Germany, but was free to continue working there.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all This is scaremongering and that 'German'(not) doctor is wheeled out. The BMA plays Chicken Little when its union members are in danger of being shown up for what they are. Remember their squealing when eye cataract operations were contracted to German & SAfrican doctors ? If they're so concerned about us, no doubt will we see surgeries opening on Sundays and all GPs making themselves available out of hours rather than outsourcing the work while they go part-time. I speak from experience. Their unavailability led to a relative spending six months confined to a ward unnecessarily. I believe that their 9-5 attitude towards work leads to des-killing, sorry I mean desk-ill-ing no..deskilling. Maybe I was right the first time.

EU laws do not demand that people are given a job even if they can't speak the language of the country they are in. If the level of English is too low, then we only have ourselves to blame. The EU Working Time Directive also has nothing to do with language. - Cloggiefootie, UK in Holland, 12/1/2012 11:14 Click to rate Rating 5 Report abuse It's unbelievable how long this is taking to sort out.

Why is it generaly accepted that the "Doctor" you will see, doesn't have to carry similar documentation? When I meet a new GP in our surgery, I can't resist just giving them a small interview prior to letting them loose on my most precious possession, ie. my body.People just take it for granted that because they have Dr at the start of their name that they are experienced and suitably qualified. My requests to doctors for their professional development information does actually take them aback and leaves them surprised and feeling awkward, but hey, if it's okay for my customers to ask for my competence on gas appliances, then I see no reason why this shouldn't apply to these people in the medical profession.

Many years ago I had a doctor release me from hospital because I questioned his nurse about what he had been saying; he was Chinese and didn't like the 'loss of face' that offends his culture. But I've just come out of hospital where the Eastern European consultant surgeon could not have been nicer, kinder or more understanding of my fears, with an excellent command of theEnglish language. On the ward, there were three nurses out of seven who had English as their mother-tongue, others were French, Asian, Pakistani and Spanish. All of them did a brilliant job. Sadly, the NHS would fall further down the drain if it weren't for foreign nationals working in it, but there should be more safeguards in place to make sure that more people have an experience more akin to my latter than my former one. - Alice, Oxfordshire, 12/1/2012 10:28 Click to rate Rating 3 Report abuse If they are incompetent and cant speak English why are they allowed to work in the NHS in the first place...
