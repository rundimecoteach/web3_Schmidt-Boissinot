This almost made him sick again. Alexis Rodriguez, 28, had visited Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Cente for pneumonia threatmen. He took the service of outpatient and the bill should have amounted to no more than $300. Rodriguez is one of the several hundred patients getting billed for tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error at the New York City hospital. Initially, Rodriguez thought the bill was legitimate. Last spring he had received a large bill when he was hospitalized for pneumonia for three weeks — but obviously not a large as this bill. The error occurred because the company that prepares the bills had mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount should go. The hospital representative said that an apology letter is being sent to everyone who received such bills.

Flight diverted to Florida for 'unruly' couple ATLANTA: Officials say a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Costa Rica was diverted to Tampa, Florida, on Sunday evening after a couple from Germany became unruly. Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley said Flight 414 departed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 6 pm on Sunday and landed at Tampa International Airport at 7:34 pm. The captain made the call to land, the spokeswoman said. After the "unruly" passengers were removed, the plane went on to Costa Rica, she said. Tampa International Airport spokeswoman Janet Zink identified the passengers as Peter and Gabriele Strohmaier of Dusseldorf, Germany. She said they were seated in first class and demanding food and champagne and refused to sit down. Zink said no charges had been filled. The FBI and Transportation Security Administration were investigating. Reached at the Tampa hotel where the couple was spending Sunday night, Gabriele Strohmaier said that a Delta crew member "exaggerated enormously and felt terribly insulted" after her husband raised concerns about the food and beverage service. She said her husband had asked for a glass of champagne, but was told it was all gone. She said the crew member then walked away rather than listen to his concerns. She denied that she or her husband was told to sit down and refused. "No, we were not standing," she said. Peter Strohmaier, who identified himself as a lawyer, said he "did nothing except to say I would like to have the meal and so on...all normal things." He said the Delta crew member told him she was not pleased with his attitude. "I am not prepared to accept such behavior," he said, adding that in the end he didn't get champagne, a meal or even water. The couple had flown to the US from Germany earlier in the day. Gabriele Strohmaier said the couple need to "take another airline, naturally not Delta" to get to Costa Rica Eight arrested for trying to smuggle gold in their... butts SEOUL: South Korean customs officials say they have arrested eight men over a scheme to allegedly smuggle gold out of the country by hiding it in their rectums.

South Korea says Japanese custom officials caught the men on their second attempt and sent them home after imposing fines. Later, one of the suspects allegedly orchestrated an unsuccessful bid to smuggle gold bars from Mongolia to Hong Kong using a similar method. Meanwhile, South Korean officials gathered evidence against them at home. They say the suspects recently admitted to the smuggling after initial denials. Weatherman fired over 'Hangover' PHILADELPHIA: Weatherman John Bolari will remember his 2010 trip to Miami for the rest of his life. He lost his job, lost $43,712.25, and his dignity due to this trip to Miami Beach in March 2010. According to msn.com Bolaris was approached by two beautiful European women at a sushi bar. He took shots with the women and also lost track of time. Next thing he remembers waking up alone and proud owner of a painting. Shortly after he received a call from his new friends informing him that he purchased the painting at an auction. All these happened on the first night he was in Miami. Bolaris again agreed to join them for another night of marry making. The next morning, Bolaris woke up alone with no memory of the previous night and the painting nowhere to be found. When he returned to Philadelphia he discovered he had purchased bottles of champagne every 15 minutes, including a $2,500 bottle of Cristal Vintage and a $3,120 bottle of Dom Perignon.

A spokeswoman from Bolaris news station said that the parting was a mutually agreed upon once Bolaris’ tale hit the mainstream media.
