<p>Hong Kong's Department of Health today ordered a recall of a batch of Allopurinol tablets made by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Nasdaq: TEVA; TASE: TEVA), after black substances were found on some tablets in two blisters of the product. Allopurinol is used to treat hyperuricaemia and gout. According to the Hong Kong distributor, International Medical Co. Ltd., the tablets are made by Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Ltd Co. in Hungary. An investigation by the Department of Health found no fungal elements, and that the black substances, which adhered on the surfaces of some tablets, bear similar features as used in hydrocarbon oil. It added that the substances might be a quality issue. The Department of Health has received no reports about adverse events related to the product, but advised patients to examine the tablets before taking them. A total of 22,965 boxes had been imported into Hong Kong and were supplied to the Health Authority, local pharmacies and private doctors. Department of Health spokesman said, "In this instance, contravention of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, selling drugs not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser, might have occurred. The maximum penalty involved is $10,000 and three months imprisonment."
