Gary Phillips of the York police. "That's the purpose of putting (the photo) out."HIV is a virus that often progresses to give people the deadly AIDS disease.Dr. Julio Montaner, director of the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, recently wrote in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that it should not be a crime for HIV-infected people to withhold their condition to sexual partners.He argued that advances in medicine have made it possible to "virtually eliminate" the risk of transmitting HIV to another person through sex.Â© Copyright (c) Postmedia NewsÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed Â Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:****Â Â Â Related Stories from Around the Web African-themed Canadian style in museum exhibit Â Daily News, Halifax Â Wednesday, January 11, 2012 Brian Francis: The men with AIDS Â The Afterword Â Wednesday, August 24, 2011 The KPMG report: Close libraries, sell the zoo, cut back on police Â Posted Toronto Â Thursday, July 21, 2011 Â Â Â Related Topics TorontoContagious and Infectious DiseasesHealth and Fitness Most Popular News Most Read E-mailed Commented Pizza: Old-school pies made perfect Former Montreal Canadiens head scout Caron remembered for Wickenheiser pick Residents to raise issue of supervised injection sites at Ville Marie council meeting Fitness: Diet is less important than being active 'Thoughtful' St-Denis jumps to Liberals Funds dry up for MTL Punk director Ãrik Cimon Â more Â» RSS Pizza: Old-school pies made perfect Fitness: Diet is less important than being active Honour killings 'a stupid thing': mother Residents to raise issue of supervised injection sites at Ville Marie council meeting Funds dry up for MTL Punk director Ãrik Cimon My first dog: Now, Buddy gets osso bucco for dinner Â more Â» RSS Sponsored By The Gazette Headline News Sign up to receive daily headline news from The Gazette.
