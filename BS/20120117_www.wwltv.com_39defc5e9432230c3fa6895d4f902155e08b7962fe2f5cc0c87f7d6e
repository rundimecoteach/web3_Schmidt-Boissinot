<p>Monica Hernandez / Eyewitness News PONCHATOULA, La. -- As red balloons reached toward the sky, those driving along Highway 22 in Ponchatoula sent prayers to a special little boy. "Baby Tripp is an inspiration to all of us. He has touched everybody's lives in this small town," said Lerai Lucas, a family friend who helped organize Sunday's "Ride for Tripp." At age 2 years and eight months, Tripp Roth died Saturday. He battled a rare skin disease called Epidermolysis Bullosa, or EB. Any touch could cause him to blisters, inside and out. It was a life filled with searing pain, but Tripp's strength captured the hearts of an entire community. "I've been keeping up with the story and cried myself to sleep many a night seeing what she was going through," said Elizabeth Savoy, who has been following Tripp's story for months. Tripp's mother, Courtney, devoted every second to her young son. And with red balloons tied to their antenaes and stuffed elmos peppering their cars, the community continued to show their support. "We prayed for him, and we stood by Courtney and supported them every step of the way," said Lucas. "And now we're not going to stop." A few bikers and family friends began planning the tribute when they heard news of Tripp's death. Less than 24 hours later, the ride for Tripp grew to include dozens of people and a police escort. "That's what they need, they're going to see how well this family is loved," said Clifford McLin, with the Harley Owner's Group. "We've got a good community here too, they know that. They know that." "I came out today just to support the family, show them that we cared and they were in our prayers, and we'll be there for them," said Chad Nicolosi, who has been following Tripp's story since day one. For the day, the stuffed Elmos were much more than toys. They were a sign of support for a grieving family. Lucas said Elmo was Tripp's favorite toy. "In 90 percent of the pictures you see of Tripp," said Lucas, "He's holding onto that Elmo." Ultimately, participants said, the ride lets Tripp's family know they're thinking about him. And they believe the boy his mother called "Angel Baby" now has his wings. "Our prayers go out to the family, because they toughed it for a long time. It's hard to let someone go that you love that much," said T.J. Lytell, a member of the Harley Owner's Group. Family friends said the pain was too great for Tripp's mother to attend Sunday's event. On her blog, http://randycourtneytripproth.blogspot.com/, Courtney Roth wrote, "He took his last peaceful breaths in my arms, in his most favorite spot. My heart literally hurts more than i ever thought was possible... Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the support through this unbearable time." The funeral will be held Wednesday at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Ponchatoula. Donations can be made in Tripp's name to the non-profit groups http://debra.org/ or http://www.childrenscancer.org/puck/. Print print Email Email this article Share Tweet Facebook Share Share!

Comments: Displaying 1 - 5 of 5 macarpen said on January 16, 2012 at 1:25 PM My heartfelt condolences to the family who loved their child so much that they dedicated their lives to keeping a child alive knowing that almost every moment of his young life was spent suffering. It must have been horrible hearing him scream out in pain at every touch. We all can find solace in the fact that this child no longer has to endure 24 hours a day of horrible, agonizing pain. May his memory never leave us. 79957079 Flag this comment Jeff_Eastwoo68a said on January 16, 2012 at 11:57 AM Those balloons people just seem to love to release in memoriam of a loved one just end up as trash that litters God's beautiful landscape. The money spent on the balloons (or in other cases, stuffed animals/flowers that people leave) could have been given to a charity that helps children. Think, people, THINK! 79952563 Flag this comment lalady said on January 16, 2012 at 11:42 AM I have never met or know Courtney, but I have to say all the stories that I have been reading and her dedication to her son is an inspiritation. There are so may woman these days that takes the lives of their young kids because their kids is an innconvience, not one time that Courtney ever considered Tripp to be an innconvience, said deserves to be mother of the year, she put her child's needs in front of hers and that is what parenthood is about. Courtney if you ever have any more kids those kids will be very lucky to have you as a mom. 79951776 Flag this comment Lisa_Thibeau2ad said on January 16, 2012 at 11:13 AM Fly High Baby Tripp Fly High!
