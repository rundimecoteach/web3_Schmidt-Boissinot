Early detection key: If caught early, the cancerous cells can be zapped with an electric current which kills them without surgery Now scientists have developed a fluorescent dye spray which sticks to healthy cells in the oesophagus but cannot attach itself to cancer cells or those in the early stages of turning cancerous. This gives a clear signpost to where the disease is developing.If caught at this stage, the cancer cells can be ‘zapped’ with an electric current which kills them without surgery. The treatment offers hope to more than 8,000 Britons a year who are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. More... Faulty breast implant row boss gave safety advice to Labour A false alarm for President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner who had surgery for suspected thyroid cancer One of the patients in the study had their entire oesophagus removed because a small pre-cancerous area had been identified – which using the dye was found to have been very small and could have been treated without surgery. Deadly: Oesophageal cancer is one of the most fatal because it is often missed or wrongly diagnosed until it is too late Two patients whose cancer had not shown up using the current imaging methods - which usually only detect when a tumour has formed - were found to have clear areas which needed treatment. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Fitzgerald, of the Medical Research Council’s Cancer Cell Unit in Cambridge said: ‘Current methods to screen for oesophageal cancer are controversial - they are costly, uncomfortable for the patient and are not completely accurate. ‘Our technique highlights the exact position of a developing oesophageal cancer, and how advanced it is, giving a more accurate picture. ‘This could spare patients radical surgery to remove the oesophagus that can result in having to eat much smaller more regular meals and worse acid-reflux.’ Cases of the disease have doubled over the past 25 years particularly in men, thought to be linked to alcohol and smoking. Only 1 in 12 people survive for five years after diagnosis. The researchers, funded by Cancer Research UK, tested the treatment on 80 biopsies from people with Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition which increases the risk of oesophageal cancer, as well as four patients with cancer. They say the dye is ‘relatively cheap’ and unlikely to cause side effects as it uses a type of wheat germ protein found in our normal diet. This binds to glycans, sugar molecules on the surface of cells inside the oesophagus and they added a flourescent tag to make it glow green under light of a specific wavelength. It can then be seen using an endoscope – an optical tube passed down the oesophagus. When diseased, the glycans’ structure changes – and current imaging methods cannot pick up these tiny changes. The test needs to be trialled on newly diagnosed patients but the researchers, whose study is published today (Mon) in the journal Nature Medicine, believe it could be used routinely on patients within five years. A UK trial is already being planned. Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Oesophageal cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect and treat. ‘We urgently need new ways to detect the cancer earlier, and this dye offers a great opportunity to treat the cancer more promptly and more successfully, potentially saving many lives a year.’ Share this article: Facebook Twitter Google+ Messenger LinkedIn Digg it Newsvine Fark Nowpublic Reddit Print article Email article Add your comments Comments (6) Here's what other readers have said.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all I may not be a 'Cambridge Don' but this says it is not a cure but a way of detecting it. If people die from the treatment rather than cancer, like you say, early detection will avoid a lot of the treatment. - Amanda, Bristol, 16/1/2012 16:19 Click to rate Rating 2 Report abuse I am the first to acknowledge that Cancer is a vile and pernicious disease but rather than get all emotional, stick my head in the sand and pretend it's not happening I prefer to obtain the optimum amount of knowledge about the 'enemy' I must confront. Drug companies are amoral. Instead of trusting somebody that is going to earn money by doing something to your body, the very least you owe yourself, is to research thoroughly. G Edward Griffin's "A World Without Cancer" is a great place to start. It's freely available on-line; you have nothing to lose other than your life. I'll give you a couple of facts. Firstly, the drug companies have NOT come up with ONE SINGLE CURE for Cancer in over One-hundred years - absolutely 'zilch'. More importantly; the majority of Cancer-deaths are as a direct result of the TREATMENT. I deal in TRUTH, unpalatable as it may be, and if I am able to encourage just one single person to pursue a CURE, I will happily face the 'Slings and Arrows'. - The Cambridge Don, Cambridge, Cambs., 16/1/2012 14:57 Click to rate Rating 5 Report abuse More 'snake-oil' which the gullible will be queuing up to obtain. And £Millions more in profits for Big-Pharma who laugh all the way to the bank. - The Cambridge Don, Cambridge ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ One could get into a long argument with someone like yourself making the kind of inflammatory satatements you are making. You could try and argue a rebuke to your accusations. But then it just becomes a pointless debate. In reality, of course 'Big Pharma' that you cite, are far from perfect. Yes, they put profits first. Of course they do. Yes, they like to produce products that will have the biggest market possible. But they are companies, not charities. And yes, there are side effects from some drugs. Old and new. But if you add up the benefits, the longer lives, the lives free of pain and suffering, against the negatives, the net result of 'Big Phama', is very much a positive. - Patricia Dow, Minster, Kent,, 16/1/2012 12:20 Click to rate Rating 8 Report abuse Cambridge Don, please give it a rest. I know many people who have been cured by those methods and remain cancer free 10, 15, 20 years later. Although I agree with your sentiments re : "Big Pharma". However, back to the subject at hand, my mother was diagnosed with this awful cancer far too late, rendering any further treatment futile. Had she not been treated for "indigestion" for 18 months and had been referred for investigations instead, she may have lived to tell the tale. Therefore, I welcome this development as this particular cancer is notoriously difficult to detect because the symptoms mimic so many minor conditions. Early diagnosis is the key. - Mrs C, Herts, 16/1/2012 11:34 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse hope is given to all the people who suffer from this, hope is also given to people that perhaps we may be able to conquer this. Hope could turn into reality and a major step forward- keep researching who knows they may be able to conquer this. - spring, essex, 16/1/2012 10:44 Click to rate Rating 20 Report abuse More 'snake-oil' which the gullible will be queuing up to obtain. And £Millions more in profits for Big-Pharma who laugh all the way to the bank. The Cancer Industry has not come up with a single cure in over one hundred years. Their expertise is in their ability to demonize cures that exist in Nature. How on earth can anybody with even the tiniest bit of common-sense believe that they can be 'cured' through burning, cutting and poisoning their bodies? Those troubled with this disease should, instead of clutching at straws, watch G Edward Griffin's "A World Without Cancer". They will then be in a better position to make an informed choice. Get healthy and stay healthy - make Big-Pharma bankrupt. - The Cambridge Don, Cambridge, Cambs., 16/1/2012 09:09 Click to rate Rating 21 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
