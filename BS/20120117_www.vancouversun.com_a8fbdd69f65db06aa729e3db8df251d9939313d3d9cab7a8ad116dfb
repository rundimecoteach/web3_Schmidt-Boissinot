"So that puts prescription drugs on the table in terms of trading off."He said this leads some people to decide the cost of the medication is more than they can afford. When people decide not to take their prescription drugs, it sets off the possibility they are putting themselves at further risk of illness, putting a potentially higher burden on the health care system.The researchers found uninsured low-income people had a 35-per-cent chance of not paying for medications, compared with less than four per cent of high-income insured people."It's a small portion of the population, but it's an important one. It's the people who you'd most expect to be affected by cost," Law said.Law said the best way to ensure people take prescribed drugs is to lower or eliminate the cost of them, a topic often avoided in the national discussion about medicare.Among the other findings in the study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, people in B.C. are the least likely to take prescribed drugs, at a rate of nearly one-in-five (17 per cent)Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver SunÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed Â Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:****Â Â Â Â Â Â Related Topics University of British ColumbiaHealth and FitnessHealth Care Issues Most Popular News Most Read E-mailed Commented Sidney Crosbyâs NHL doomsday clock resumes ticking Petra Kvitova recovers to advance at Australian Open Canucksâ Kesler not happy with coach Vigneault's critique of his game Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Ducks catch rival Canucks on a 'fowl' night Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Â more Â» RSS Deepak Chopra yoga centre opens in Vancouver Soccer mom jailed for siphoning more than $200,000 from Richmond youth Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Most stressful jobs of 2012 Conceal baby's sex due to Asian abortion trend: CMAJ editorial Â more Â» RSS Sponsored By Breaking News Alerts Sign up to receive e-mail alerts on breaking news from The Vancouver Sun.
