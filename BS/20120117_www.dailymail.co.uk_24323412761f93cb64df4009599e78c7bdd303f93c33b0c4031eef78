Father of 14: Trent Arsenault is a virgin at 36 yet has fathered an astonishing 14 children by donating his sperm to needy couples The revelation on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: 'I coined this term "donor sexual" and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that.' More... Want a long and happy life? Head to Raleigh, North Carolina, America's healthiest city for women The hot new sex toy set to transform the market... that was inspired by an electric toothbrush An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: 'So you do not have sex?''I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin,' the donor explained. 'Except I'll have 15 plus kids' - a statement that bought with it applause from the audience to the confusion of the host. Slow clap: Anderson Cooper laughs in confusion as the audience applauded Mr Arsenault's virgin dad status The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage. A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a 'a thrill.' The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.'I'm trying to not get too emotional,' he said. 'I’m just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that.' Thrilled: The donor was visibly moved by meeting one of his offsrping for the first time on the show. He said he hoped she has the gene of compassion Via a website, he touts his sperm as being organic but a health expert on the show warned that his unusual approach to fatherhood opens the door to spreading viral diseases such as HIV.Her fears echo those of the FDA which claims Mr Arsenault did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading and found him to be unlawfully manufacturing human cells. The agency issued a 'cease-and-desist order' in what is the first ever case of its kind involving a private sperm donor in the U.S.Mr Arsenault said in the past that he is simply helping out childless couples in situation where the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger.He told Huffington Post: ‘I'm helping people in need... I'm not running a business here.'video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player Share this article: Facebook Twitter Google+ Messenger LinkedIn Digg it Newsvine Fark Nowpublic Reddit Print article Email article Add your comments Comments (114) Here's what other readers have said.

I had to read back through and still can't see why. If it was a sucessful career woman who had also acted as surrogate for multiple partners but had no interest in intimate relationships, I doubt so many would be shouting 'Aspergers!'. I'm not saying he hasn't, but just wondering where all the amature doctors are coming from an how hey got that from 'doesn't want a relationship and donates sperm'. - Dan, Manchester, 17/1/2012 12:19 Click to rate Rating 4 Report abuse Frank, Wirral, 17/1/2012 12:10 Hush he's not talked about ;) - Halo, Norwich/Norfolk, 17/1/2012 12:16 Click to rate Rating 1 Report abuse i have seen average looking people having the most beautiful of children. - Halo, Norwich/Norfolk, 17/1/2012 08:40 That is so true!

We had spent 3.5k at clinics and had ran out of money. He didn't charge and just wanted to help couples have a baby. He is a clean as whistle and I had seen all of his medical certificates saying so. Do you know your partner is clean when you first meet them? Keep up the good work I say!
