If the compound is proven to have the same effect in humans, it could help pave the way to a cure for alcoholism, said Dr. Jing Liang, the studyâs lead author and an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of California in Los Angeles, in an interview with Postmedia News. For others who enjoy an occasional drink but would rather not endure the pounding hangover headache the next day, taking the compound also could be âan easy way to erase the uncomfortable feelings,â said Liang.Hovenia is an extract from the Chinese Raisin Tree.In Asia, Liang said hovenia has been taken as an herbal supplement to treat hangovers for at least 500 years. However, the effectiveness of hovenia as a drug to treat alcohol dependency has never before been closely studied.Liang said she became interested in taking a closer look at hovenia when she noticed that when people consumed alcohol along with food cooked with hovenia â as it is also a spice used for cooking in Asia â they seemed to avoid getting drunk.In order to study how hovenia works, Liang said she needed to isolate the specific compound that was blocking the effect of alcohol. The answer turned out to be dihydromyricetin, or DHM.Liang and her research team at UCLA began testing the compound on rats.They devised a series of tests to determine what would happen to rats if they were given just alcohol, or alcohol along with DHM. For the group given alcohol, the ratsâ behaviour when intoxicated was not unlike that of humans, she said.When you give a rat alcohol, they act âtotally like a human,â said Liang. âYou give an animal alcohol and then theyâre drunk, and they lose consciousness. They go to sleep.âBut the rats who were given alcohol plus DHM, showed no signs of intoxication, Liang said.âThey donât (get) drunk,â said Liang. âIt was amazing. I was so excited.âThe rats in the alcohol group slept for about 70 minutes, while those in the DHM group only slept for about 10 minutes. Others didnât sleep at all, she said. In another test, the researchers administered DHM to rats who were given alcohol for a prolonged period of time. Their symptoms of alcohol dependency were significantly reduced.âFrom this experiment, even if you establish a high drinking level of alcohol and then give them DHM, their dependence will reduce,â said Liang.The rats given DHM along with alcohol did not have any hangover symptoms either, she said.The next step, if she is able to secure enough funding, is to test the studyâs findings in human clinical trials, said Liang. She expects to see the same results in humans, and without any negative side effects.âFor more than 500 years (that hovenia has been used as a supplement), there have been no reports of poison or toxicity,â she said. âItâs really safe.âLiangâs goal is to turn DHM into a medication, possibly in a gum, patch or spray-form, she said. She already has patented her idea.Alcohol-use disorders are a major public-health problem around the world, said Liang.In her study, she wrote that there are only three medications â oral naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram â currently approved for treating alcohol dependence by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.However, Liang said these drugs have major side-effects and have not been proven effective in treating the disorders. Bernard Le Foll, a pharmacology professor at the University of Toronto, said the studyâs findings are âvery promisingâ for the treatment of alcohol addiction.âI think itâs very interesting,â he told Postmedia News. âItâs building on the use of an old plant in Chinese medicine and they seem to have been able to isolate what seems to be the active ingredient.âHowever, Le Foll does not recommend people start taking hovenia to treat their hangovers just yet.âMore experiments need to be done. We need to validate this in human subjects,â he said. âBut what is clear from this experiment is that . . . some drugs appear to accelerate the elimination of alcohol from the body, and also it seems to reduce the desire to drink alcohol.âtfletcher@postmedia.comTwitter.com/ThandiFletcherÂ© Copyright (c) Postmedia NewsÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed More on This StoryÂ Hangover mythsBinge drinking can damage young brains: StudyBinge drinkers need to use more of their brain to learn, study suggestsScientists find gene linked to alcohol consumptionOttawa alcoholism program still controversial, despite signs of progressÂ Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:****Â Â Â Â Â Â Hovenia is an extract from the Chinese Raisin Tree.Photograph by: mauroguanandi, Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)Â Â Â E-mail this GalleryPrint this GalleryShare this GalleryÂ Â Â Photo Galleries » More Photo Galleries Fashion stars of the Golden Globes...A look at celebrities who showed top style on the ...more Â»Â Fashion flops at the Golden Globes...What the stars wore at the 69th annual Golden Globe...more Â»Â Does the Golden Globe award for...A comparison of awards for best actress at both shows...more Â»Â More Photo Galleries » Â Â Related Topics Jing LiangAddiction and RecoveryAlcoholism Most Popular News Most Read E-mailed Commented Sidney Crosbyâs NHL doomsday clock resumes ticking Petra Kvitova recovers to advance at Australian Open Canucksâ Kesler not happy with coach Vigneault's critique of his game Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Ducks catch rival Canucks on a 'fowl' night Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Â more Â» RSS Deepak Chopra yoga centre opens in Vancouver Soccer mom jailed for siphoning more than $200,000 from Richmond youth Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Most stressful jobs of 2012 Conceal baby's sex due to Asian abortion trend: CMAJ editorial Â more Â» RSS Sponsored By Breaking News Alerts Sign up to receive e-mail alerts on breaking news from The Vancouver Sun.
