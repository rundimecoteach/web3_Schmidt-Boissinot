Rock Veilleux of the Canadian Forces and Maj. Frank Wegener of the German Air Force, who was flying the aircraft.A report released Wednesday by the air force's Directorate of Flight Safety said they noticed a change in the engine sound, then a warning light.Declaring an emergency, they prepared for a forced landing, but had to eject a mile short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the resulting crash inside the base's perimeter.The investigation indicated fatigue caused a low-pressure turbine blade to crack, then fail. The engine vibrated so badly that it seized.An investigation to determine the cause of the fatigue is ongoing, the report said.A report into a 2001 Hawk crash at Cold Lake also noted a missing low-pressure turbine blade from the engine, "which is similar to LPT blade failures in four previous CF Hawk aircraft occurrences."Â© Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-PostÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed Â Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:****Â Â Â Â Â Â Related Topics Moose Jaw (Saskatchewan)Frank WegenerRock Veilleux Most Popular News Most Read E-mailed Commented Sponsored By Breaking News Alert Sign up to receive e-mail alerts on breaking news from The Leader Post.
