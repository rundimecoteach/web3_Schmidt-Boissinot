The increased mobility of health professionals in the EU has highlighted huge variations both in the practical abilities of professionals of similar grades, and in the systems set up to ensure quality, in different member states."In response, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: "We agree that for too long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to operate in the UK without the necessary safeguards. That's why I announced last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who can't speak English properly."He added: "We want to revise the [European working time directive] to give the NHS the flexibility it needs on training. Our overriding concern must be to protect patients." COMMENTS COMMENT NAME EMAIL (NOT DISPLAYED) TOWN / COUNTRY / ORGANISATION YOUR COMMENT WILL BE APPROVED BY A MODERATORHTML CODE IS NOT PERMITTED.
