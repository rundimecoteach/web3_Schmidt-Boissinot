Serious accidents triple for pedestrians wearing headphones By Jenny Hope Last updated at 7:50 AM on 17th January 2012 Comments (73) Share Worrying: Serious accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones while using electronic devices have tripled. Pictured is Robbie Williams listening to music while out on a stroll Serious accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones while using electronic devices such as iPods have tripled, warn researchers.They found a dramatic rise in injuries to people using headphones while walking in the street, particularly among young men.There is increasing concern about the near trance-like state people can apparently enter while using mobile phones, MP3 players or electronic personal organisers. Psychologists call this ‘divided attention’ or ‘inattentional blindness’ and it has become a focus for road safety campaigners. A U.S. study shows the number of people suffering serious injury while using headphones tripled in six years.The research, published in the Injury Prevention journal, analysed U.S. data from 2004 to last year on injuries to pedestrians using headphones. Cases involving mobile phones, including hands-free, or cyclists were excluded.During the study period, there were a total of 116 reports of death or injury, jumping from 16 in 2004/5 to 47 in 2010/11. Eighty-one of the 116 collisions – 70 per cent – resulted in the person dying. In a quarter of cases a warning – such as a horn or siren – was sounded before the crash.Two out of three victims were men and under the age of 30, with around one in ten of all cases under the age of 18. More... Could the next iPhone be waterproof? Apple and Samsung both 'talking to' spray-on proofing company Nine out of ten cases occurred in urban areas and more than half of the victims were struck by trains.The data used in the analysis was from the U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google news archives and a university research database. Private world: Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street Study leader Dr Richard Lichenstein, of the University of Maryland Hospital for Children in Baltimore, said: ‘The use of headphones may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles.’Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli, such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street. Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, said: ‘Pedestrians and cyclists seem to get lost in a private cocoon when they’re on a mobile in the street, or wearing headphones.‘Precise figures don’t appear to be available here. There are many close calls. You’ve only got to look around to see it’s on the rise.’ Share this article: Facebook Twitter Google+ Messenger LinkedIn Digg it Newsvine Fark Nowpublic Reddit Print article Email article Add your comments Comments (73) Here's what other readers have said.

Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all Why blame mere Headphones when they've been in use in Walkmans etc since 1980 odd so are hardly the culprit here? Microphones are more likely the source of the problem as a modern mobile distraction. - Stuart, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 17/1/2012 15:54 Click to rate Rating (0) Report abuse You see these trace like people everywhere you go, it must be affecting their >Mental Health<. - Carl Barron, Christchurch, Dorset, 17/1/2012 15:35 Click to rate Rating (0) Report abuse What about the cyclists and drivers wearing head/earphones? When I had my first Walkman in 1982 there was a clear warning in the instructions NOT to use it when in control of a vehicle, and to take care as a pedestrian (for most of the time as a pedestrian, you're not actually in any danger - it only becomes really dangerous when you come to cross a road). And yet, 20 years later, it seems that some people still find that to be perfectly acceptable. That absolutely astounds me. - Tabitha, Coventry, 17/1/2012 14:19 Click to rate Rating (0) Report abuse Who actually pays for these "studies" to be carried out. Maybe if we start looking at more important things such as disease prevention or something that will actually benefit the human race we could actually make a difference. As far as im concerned if your stupid enough to walk into oncoming traffiv then you are doing the world a favour by removing yourself from the gene pool. - Steely, Inverness, 17/1/2012 13:48 Click to rate Rating 2 Report abuse I see alot of people driving whilst wearing headphones (listening to music?). Surely this must constitute driving without due care and attention? It's up there with driving with music blaring out - daft!! It's hard sometimes to concentrate with the radio on or a small child yellling (!) in the back let alone having earphones in. - Kitty, Colchester, Essex, 17/1/2012 13:38 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse Jaywalking is not an offence in this country - we are one of the few countries that do not have an anti jaywalking law and people wonder why pedestrians keep getting knocked down. This will not change while the powers that be decide the motorist is to blame for every accident regardless of fault. - Frizzen, Cardiff, 17/1/2012 11:39 ______________________________________________________________ There might not be a "Jaywalking Law", but it's illegal illegal to be on the Highway without lawful authority or excuse. Otherwise you are "obstructing the Highway" - you don't have to be obstructing traffic - and that applies equally on pedestrian crossings. Hence police prosecuting protesters who think they can get away with marching backwards and forwards across a road if they do it on a zebra crossing. The pity is, that's the only time you'll ever hear of the police using the law against a dangerous, never mind careless or inconsiderate, pedestrian. - Mr B J Mann, Nottingham, 17/1/2012 13:19 Click to rate Rating 7 Report abuse I've no problem with the headphones. It's walking down the street and through doorways while phoning or texting that infuriates me as those that do it are seflish are totally oblivious to what's going on around them. - Terence, Norfolk, 17/1/2012 13:16 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse The problem is as least as much about drivers who don't take the time to check whether people have looked at them, they drive as if people are aware of them by noise. Deaf people are more likely to be hit by cars, that's not because they are doing anything wrong, it's drivers assuming everyone knows they are there. We just need to slow down and watch pedestrians more closely. - Rosa 17/1 7:44 ________________________________________________________________ What would you like drivers to slow to? 0mph? In case a zombie ipod user or, supposedly, a blind person, jogs, without warning, into the middle of their lane, one inch in front of them? Have you ever read the pedestrians' section of the Highway Code? Do you even know it exists! What about pedestrians assuming all drivers know, not only that they are there, but that they are about to dash across the road? If you expect drivers to do that, why do you think it unreasonable for pedestrians to guess there might be cars on the roads? - Mr B J Mann, Nottingham, 17/1/2012 13:11 Click to rate Rating 8 Report abuse What's Robbie got to do with it? - Union Jack, Staffs, 17/1/2012 13:06 Click to rate Rating 6 Report abuse I live in a area highly populated by students. On 4 occasions this year alone I have had to break swerve to avoid a phone engrossed student stepping of the curb and into the road without a care in the world other than whose tweeting, texting or facebooking them. - AF, York, 17/1/2012 13:01 Click to rate Rating 10 Report abuse The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
