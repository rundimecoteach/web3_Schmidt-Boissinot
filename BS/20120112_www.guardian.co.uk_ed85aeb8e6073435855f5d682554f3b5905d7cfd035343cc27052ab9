Research findings do not contradict that breastfeeding is normal and the most healthy form of infant nutrition. Photograph: Christinne Muschi/Reuters Breastfed babies cry more, laugh less, and generally have "more challenging temperaments" than formula-fed infants, a study has found. But such behaviour is normal, and mothers should learn to cope with it rather than reach for the bottle, according to researchers.Infant irritability was said to be a natural part of the "dynamic communication" between mothers and babies.Bottle-feeding was akin to "comfort eating" – producing quieter and apparently more content babies who may be over-nourished and putting on weight too rapidly.The study rated the temperament of 316 babies at age three months using a 191-item behaviour questionnaire completed by their mothers.Scores differed between babies who were exclusively breast-fed, bottle-fed or mixed-fed.In three broad areas, breast and mixed-fed babies were rated as being more difficult to deal with than bottle-fed babies.The study authors wrote in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE: "In particular, compared to formula-fed infants, breastfed infants were reported to show greater distress, less smiling, laughing and vocalisation, to be slower to calm down following distress or excitement, and more difficult to soothe by care-givers."The findings may help explain why so many mothers give up on breastfeeding after a short time, despite the strong health message that "breast is best" for growing infants.Department of Health guidelines say mothers should exclusively breastfeed their babies for the first six months after birth.According to a 2005 survey, three-quarters of new UK mothers start out breastfeeding their babies, but only a third are still doing so after four months.Study leader Dr Ken Ong, from the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge, urged mothers to persevere despite the difficulties, and seek help if they need it."There is an overwhelming body of evidence supporting breastfeeding as the normal and most healthy form of infant nutrition, and our findings do not contradict this," he said."Bottle-fed babies may appear more content, but research suggests that these infants may be over-nourished and gain weight too quickly. Our findings are essentially similar to other stages of life; people often find that eating is comforting."He added: "Rather than being put off breastfeeding, parents should have more realistic expectations of normal infant behaviour and should receive better understanding and support to cope with difficult infant behaviours if needed. These approaches could potentially promote successful breastfeeding, because currently many mothers attempt to breastfeed but give up after the first few weeks."Babies involved in the research were among 1,526 infants enrolled into the Cambridge Baby Growth Study.Mothers assessed their babies' behaviour at three months using the Revised Infant Behaviour Questionnaire, a recognised method of rating various aspects of infant temperament.Of the infants, 137 were exclusively breastfed, 88 were exclusively bottle-fed, and 91 were fed with a mixture of formula and breast milk. No differences in behaviour were seen between boys and girls.The researchers concluded: "Infants who were breastfed or mixed-fed at three months of age were rated by their mothers as having overall more challenging temperaments."They pointed out that similar behaviour had been widely studied in a variety of bird and mammal species."Humans often perceive infant crying as stress, but for infant animals irritability is a normal component of signalling to parents," the authors wrote.How infants signal their needs to mothers "The expression of offspring demand is part of a dynamic signalling system between parents and offspring … zoologists assume that offspring transmit signals of nutritional need, and that parents respond with an appropriate transfer of food."Crying and irritability were likely to act as an "honest signal" of nutritional need during early infancy, when a lot of energy was needed for growth, said the scientists.They added: "Mothers who breastfeed may perceive that other people's formula-fed babies are more content, and evidence suggests that some mothers believe that the main cause of infant distress is hunger. The most consistent reason given for women to stop breastfeeding is that 'breast milk alone didn't satisfy my baby', which reflects mothers' perception of signalling by the infant."Mothers could receive more information about the behavioural dynamics of breastfeeding so as to have a better expectation and understanding of normal infant temperament and, where necessary, support to cope with difficult aspects of infant temperament."Dr Janine Stockdale, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: "It cannot be presumed that physical signalling by the baby automatically means it is hungry; other evidence suggests that babies engage in sucking behaviour called non-nutritive sucking."The evidence needs to be seen in a greater context before we start to draw conclusions on this research and we should continue to do all we can to promote and increase the rates of breastfeeding."

But some will be made very ill by formula.They will be left with allergies, asthma, lower IQ. They are three times more likely to get gastronenteritis, ear infections and are much more likely to be hospitalised in the first year due to being less able to fight off infections.The numbers are small - about 1% of breastfed babies will get gastroenteritis, whereas 3% of formula fed babies will.So you are right that most formula fed babies will be perfectly healthy.

One was irritable, needy and sensitive. The other was placid, easy going and charming. And guess what. At 27 and 25, they are still the same. It's personality.One thing I will say, breastfeeding taught me to be patient, observant, and responsive. Sometimes a cranky grumbling baby doesn't need a feed (providing he is gaining weight appropriately) - he needs a change of scenery, or a different set of arms for a little spell. I was lucky though. I had excellent support from my physician, my midwives and my friends. Surely in this day and age, we shouldn't be arguing over the benefits of breastmilk? My own experience: my children never had an ear infection, no skin problems, asthma or allergies. I was fed on 1950s era "formula" (Carnation Evaporated Milk mixed with something else, I can't recall what my mum told me it was.) I have battled allergies, digestive problems and skin problems all my life. I know that's only anecdotal, but it's convincing enough for me. Recommend?

I don't know where these pushy HCP supposed to live? All they do is give you a pamphlet about breastfeeding. My experience is that they shove formula down on you at every single opportunity. The health visitors are very lasse faire about how you feed. Once you are in the hospital, they actively discourage you to actually breastfeed. I think it's because the doctors like to measure exactly how much it gets into the baby so they hate the idea of breastfeeding.From my own experience. My daughter was readmitted for jaundice after birth. She was breastfed and has gained back her birth weight very quickly (2-3 days). But on admission, and being a naive first time mum, because we have been waiting for so long for tests, daughter got hungry and cried. I wanted to put her on the breast. The doctor intervened and told me no, we won't allow you to breastfeed here. We wanted her to get into the bilibed as quickly as possible and that means we are going to get a tube in and give her formula. Result was a crying baby for 30min and they couldn't put her in the bilibed until she calmed down. If I had put her on the breast, she would be calmed in 10min because that's how long she fed as a newborn. But because food is down her stomach via a tube, she didn't register she got food, and so kept crying and crying, with 2 pairs of strangers hand man-handling her. It's a bloody disgrace. If there is a next time, I will just put baby onto my breast without asking. They couldn't stop what's started.My next experience is the same about doctors and breastfeeding. Daughter was back for bronchiolitis at 7 months. Multiple doctors asked how much formula she drank. I just replied she is breastfed (with solids ofc) so I don't know. They just give me that really annoyed look. And they were tube feeding her something like 100ml every 3 hours. Obviously we have to use formula top up. They have no idea that once they reach around a month, the amount of breastmilk they drink stay static, unlike formula. This is because breastmilk changes with the age of the baby. (In fact she gets around 200ml for a whole day at nursery).What I'm saying is in my experience, HCP pays lip service to breastfeeding but is very much anti in practice. Recommend? (23) Responses (1) Report | Link miladear 11 January 2012 1:35PM I am trying to imagine how I would have done filling in a 191-item behavioural questionnaire when my daughter was 3 months old. Well done to all those women having the time and energy to participate in the study.I breastfed my child until for over 7 months old and have been thinking a lot why it worked so well for us. Firstly, I informed myself on how breastfeeding works and what to expect BEFORE I gave birth. Still I was caught out by the fact that breastfeeding was quite painful for the first 2 weeks. I wish it's made more clear that even with the correct latch, women could still experience pain, but it does get easier eventually. I reckon that's one of the main reasons why so many women give up so soon.Then there is the sheer tiredeness of producing milk on daily basis. I am a fit heathly person but still found breastfeeding physically exhausting. Combined with the broken night's sleep, I am not surprised that breatsfeeding mothers report their babies as more irritable.I find the continuous juxtaposition of breast- and bottle-feeding pretty pointless on the whole. With the best of their intentions, many mother end up struggling with breastfeeding and give up for one reason or another. Making them feel bad for having to resolve to bottlefeeding is in noone's favour. I'd rather there was more practical/ realistic information on how both methods work and letting people make up their mind in a non-judgemental environment. Recommend? (15) Responses (2) Report | Link kerryanne 11 January 2012 1:40PM I think many of the claims the NHS make about breast feeding being better, wouldn't stand up to serious scientific scrutiny, so the critisims of nuisverige are unfair.Breast feeding is only best if it is best for everyone and that includes the mother. For me it wasn't possible, and I was made to feel terrible about it. I would have loved to breast feed, however the more I have looked into formula the happier I am with the way things worked out. I have a content baby, and my husband gets to share in the joy of feeding our son. Failing to breast feed is not failure as a mother, but that is often implied by people who are set on telling women what to do with their bodies. Having a baby is a senstive enough time without a woman being undermined for feeding her baby the way that is best for her. Recommend?

I'm 22w with twins, just started twins-specific antenatal classes and one session - 1/4 of the short time we have - is given over to breastfeeding. We could have spent a whole session talking about any one of: recognising the signs of premature labour, or gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, or the implications of placenta previa (we're at higher risk of all of the above), or whether there are any special considerations for looking after smaller or premature babies, but all that stuff is shoved in together on the day we tour the maternity ward. And they're going to spend 2h lecturing us on BF when realistically, any advice they can give us there (in a cramped, overheated room with about 30 couples and someone's older kids running around) they could just as easily have written down.I think some HCPs just enjoy making mothers feel guilty, whatever they do.

(2) Responses (0) Report | Link miladear 11 January 2012 6:47PM Response to cornwallsharon, 11 January 2012 4:57PM Exactly my point. Bearing in mind that my daughter and I had pretty straigthforward breastfeeding experience and she has always been the most easy-going baby and has never taken more than 5 mins to settle if she has been upset about something. However I did have a very low point when, after 5,5 months of broken night's sleep the tiredeness was taking its tall and I was becoming an insomniac. One night I went to bed at the same time as her trying to catch up on sleep and was simply unable to wind down despite being absolutely shattered. So when she woke up for a feed 4 hours later I fed her crying and telling my husband I simply could not take this anymore. Luckily instead of giving up on the breastfeeding, we took a very gentle approach at steering my daughter towards sleeping through, which she did within a week. She is exclusively breastfed at the time, not weaned yet. It was a win-win situation for both of us and in hindsight I was very happy that I didn't stop breatsfeeding sooner than I had planned.I think poor sleep is a major factor why so many women decide to stop breastfeeding and having experienced it first-hand I would never judge a woman for doing so. There is still hardly any available information on the science of infant and toddler sleep and its relation to feeding. I read a lot of the subject as I wanted to make an informed desicion as a parent and the best book I have come across is Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child by Dr Marc Weissbluth. Sleeping through and how long babies should sleep and should or should they not be sleep trained is a very hot topic amongst mums and I feel that NHS should be doing more to provide scientifically supported advice for new parents.

As a bottle feeding mother, I find that assertion insulting. And with all due respect, formula milk is designed for babies. A huge amount of research has gone into developing it. The WHO study you are refering to is actually quite balanced about breast vs. bottle, it points out that formula feeding is problematic for people in countries where water and sterilisation would create safety issue, but if formula can be prepared correctly it is perfectly acceptable alternative.

(6) Responses (0) Report | Link Caichi 11 January 2012 7:06PM Can I just point out that the studies in general do not show that breast feeding is better but that formula is detrimental to babies’ health/development. Breast feeding is the natural way of feeding human babies. It is the way in which all babies as mammals were meant to be fed. Most research is done on breast feeding (what’s normal) instead of evaluating the experiment – formula. If research shows that breast fed babies have higher IQ then what it really means that formula feeding negatively affects IQ. Recommend?

I have been breastfeeding my son since birth for the past 5 months. I intially had a low milk supply, confirmed by doctors as a result of my son having a tongue tie and not latching and stimulating my supply enough and had to top up with formula . However, my baby is lactose intolerant and standard formulas made him very sick. We used prescription formula but once he had a procedure to correct the to the tie, have been able to just breastfeed.If a mother is able to breastfeed then of course it's best. The milk is made for that child, boosts their immune system and is superior in nutrition. My son is an incredibly happy baby so this report really doesn't reflect him at all.Nuisverge, you sound to me like someone who is angrily trying to defend their own parenting choices. I find it incredulous that your daughter, a paediatrician would actually wilfully choose formulae feeding over breastfeeding without even trying to breastfeed first. That seems very strange for someone in that line of work. Recommend? (8) Responses (0) Report | Link apov63 11 January 2012 7:22PM Breastfeeding was one of the highlights of my life. I loved it. My health visitor told me to feed on demand, and my now 11 year old son, still has that attitude. He did treat me like an object (a boob ) when he was a baby, he seemed to treat his dad more like a person, and I did find that very difficult at times, but I think I have more understanding of what was going on now. We are incredibly close and have a very lively relationship. Recommend? (3) Responses (0) Report | Link Royfan 11 January 2012 7:33PM I've been ebf for nearly 6 months. I understood from friends advice that it's a skill, not something you can necessarily do straight off. I went to see a breastfeeding councillor 3 days after giving birth. Within a week I'd cracked it and not my nipples!Why is it such a competition? Being a mum (and dad) is demanding. I don't deserve a medal for breastfeeding and I would have been gutted if I couldn't have done it. All the breast is best business would have devastated me. I will say that breast is very convenient, I don't have to pack a huge bag when I go out, I can plug my baby on on the numerous occasions he wakes during the night and saving the best for last I weigh less now than before getting pregnant. Back on topic, my boy is happy, smiley and chilled. He cries when he wants food, but I gather that's because he can't ask just yet Recommend?

Our twins were 5 weeks early and one found it difficult to feed (he would probably have found a bottle easier) BUT emotionally I felt it important to feed them, medically I believed the evidence that it was beneficial for preterm babies in particular and financially it made a difference (we didn't have space in our kitchen for a steriliser and a huge fridge for a double load of bottles and couldn't afford a new house)I did get support from the nursing staff - esp the breastfeeding advisor who normally spent her time supporting staff but made time for me. I hope your daughter would not have been negative ... but actually as she was unlikely to buy us a steriliser, enough bottles to hold milk for 2 babies, a fridge big enough to keep them in (never mind the space to put all of this in) and pay for another person to hold the other bottle and baby, it really doesn't matter - breast feeding was the only way it was going to work for us.

They are not statistically sound and they are generally conducted in Third World countries, where the water to make formula is of a lower standard and less hygienic, and many of the mothers do not have the requisite skills to sterilise the bottles or make an accurate mixture. Breast feeding is the natural way of feeding human babies.Since when have human beings lived a "natural" life? Do you live naked on the plains of Africa, foraging in the forest for your dinner? Are you infested with fleas and do you have a life expectancy of about 30? That's "natural" for a primate.Most research is done on breast feeding (what’s normal) instead of evaluating the experiment – formula. If research shows that breast fed babies have higher IQ then what it really means that formula feeding negatively affects IQ.You have chosen to accept the studies which confirm your own belief rather than accepting other studies which cast serious doubts on the IQ claims. You favour breastfeeding so you go along with whatever empirical evidence supports your own contention. Rumbelow, a statistician, has shown that the implication that breastfeeding gives children a higher IQ can not be reliably substantiated by the data the researchers used, and she explains why such conclusions can not be drawn - if you choose to read the research.My eldest daughter, who is knowledgeable on this topic and has reviewed all the research studies, has concluded that there is little evidence that an otherwise healthy child is significantly harmed by a mother's choice to feed with formula. She advises expectant mothers accordingly - but quietly because it's not the "official line". Recommend?

You somehow seem to have gained the impression that my daughter is against breastfeeding and I can't fathom why you have made such an assumption. What my daughter actually "supports" is mothers making their own choices - with information but without any pressure from professionals. If you wanted to breastfeed, she would support you 100% in your decision - so long as it was YOUR decision, and you were not browbeaten into it by some busybody chiming dodgy medical "facts". Recommend? (0) Responses (0) Report | Link Cod23 11 January 2012 9:04PM Also, breastfeeding lowers the risks of breast cancer substantially. The main problem is that most women need to go back to work and it is very hard to keep on breast feeding, expressing at work etc... In reality most women will not be able to do this. Recommend?

I wish it's made more clear that even with the correct latch, women could still experience pain, but it does get easier eventually. I reckon that's one of the main reasons why so many women give up so soon." I totally, totally agree with this. The pro breastfeeding PR people are so caught up in trying to promote it that they are actually shooting themselves in the foot by not being honest. It is so worth persevering but if you are forewarned about the pain (nothing to do with the latch, the let-down of milk itself stings at first) and are told that it WILL go, then it is easier to get through it and end up with pain free breast feeding - rather than quitting and being made to feel an utter failure because you think you can't master the latching on and you and/or baby can't manage to breastfeed.Also, when I had both my daughters, 12 and 6 years ago, the pro-BF movement was as vociferous as it is today, but then as now there was little practical help on the maternity ward and no suggestion by anyone to put the baby to the breast when it was born. Unless I'd educated myself beforehand I would have been left with no help whatsoever. Recommend?
