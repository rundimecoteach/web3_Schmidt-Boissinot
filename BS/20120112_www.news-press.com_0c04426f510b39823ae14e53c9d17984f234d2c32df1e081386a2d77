It serves about 900 children in foster care. The organization scored well on keeping children from re-entering care and seen within 30 days but was on the lower end in preventing multiple foster care placements and obtaining timely medical and dental care.Network CEO Nadereh Salim said in a statement that she was supportive of the scorecard system. Aimee McLaughlin, a network spokeswoman, said in an email that she and Salim were unavailable to talk Wednesday.Stan Appelbaum, a founder of the Friends of Foster Children, said the network has worked to recruit more dentists and improve communication with foster parents. Appelbaum is also a Childrens Network board member. He said it is difficult to tap stable placements for some of the most troubled children.They come in pretty damaged. When a child is moved around as much as they are in the foster care system, Im not sure that we can blame anyone, he said. We have to try to improve that.Another area hed like to better is the percentage of former foster children with a high school diploma or GED. The scorecard showed that 31 percent of young adults locally had reached that benchmark. The state standard is about 40 percent.
