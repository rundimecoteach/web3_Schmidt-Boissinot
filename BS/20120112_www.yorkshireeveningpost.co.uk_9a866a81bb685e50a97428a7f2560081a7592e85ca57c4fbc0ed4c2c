By Katie Baldwin Published on Thursday 12 January 2012 08:51 A woman has spoken of the fears which led her to have her controversial PIP breast implants removed. Kate Ward decided to have the surgery over worries that the French-made implants could rupture.She spent thousands having them replaced at a Leeds private hospital earlier this week - when they were found to be leaking. Now she is hoping for redress through legal action against the firm which carried out her original surgery.The 31-year-old told the YEP: “I just feel really relieved.“Now I’m very determined to get justice, not just for me but everybody in the same situation.”Women have been panicked by the scandal affecting implants made by French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), which were banned last year after they were found to contain non-medical grade silicone.Ms Ward, from Methley, Leeds, had her breast enlargement in 2005 because of “body image” issues.She had the procedure done by the Harley Medical Group at a clinic in Yorkshire, going from a B to a DD cup.In April 2010, she heard about concerns over PIP implants and went for a consultation with her original surgeon. However the mum to 10-year-old Logan was left dissatisfied and contacted solicitors Hugh James, which is representing 700 women with PIP implants, joining their legal case. Through her GP, she saw specialists on the NHS and decided to have her implants replaced. As the NHS will only pay for removal of PIP implants if they were put in privately, Ms Ward spent around £5,000 on having them replaced at the Nuffield Hospital in Leeds. Surgeon Philip Turton found that about 4 per cent of the gel in the implants had “bled” out.“There are no health implications for me because they managed to remove everything,” Ms Ward said.“But in general it’s hard to say because the gel migrates and they don’t know how long its going to take to travel.“They don’t know exactly how it will affect women but it could have a negative effect.”Harley Medical Group said yesterday they would not replace PIP implants free of charge.The firm declined to comment on Ms Ward’s case.
