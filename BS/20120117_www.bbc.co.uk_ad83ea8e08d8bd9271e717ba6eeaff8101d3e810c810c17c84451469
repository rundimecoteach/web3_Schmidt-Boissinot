They say it can have consequences for the host nation and for people when they return to their own countries. There are also important issues to consider in handling large numbers of people, they say. A series of reports, in The Lancet Infectious Disease journal, has been highlighting the risks.

"The issue for us is to make sure the right system is in place to respond."
