Robin Gibb, formerly a member of the Bee Gee's, performing at the Palais Theatre, St Kilda. Picture: Chris Scott Source: Herald Sun BEE Gee Robin Gibb has turned to a team of alternative medics as he battles liver cancer. The singer was diagnosed with the disease last year. He has received conventional treatment, including seven rounds of chemotherapy. Doctors were pleased with his progress but Gibb decided to seek other ways of recovery. "Bee Gees star Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland as he battles liver cancer," British newspaper The Sun reported. It is claimed the group is on hand to help Gibb 24 hours a day. The "naturopath nutritionists" encourage him to eat foods that are good for the body so it is as strong as possible as he fights the disease. The star's wife Dwina reportedly asked her husband to speak to the professionals as she is a big believer in natural medication. It is believed Gibb, 62, has also been spending time in a special detox hut where he sweats and loses toxins. "Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this disease," an insider said. Gibb's diagnosis was first reported in November and came after the musician was seen looking increasingly frail in public. Soon after his diagnosis was reported, Gibb posted a message on his website reassuring fans he was doing well. "I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me," he wrote. "I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all."
