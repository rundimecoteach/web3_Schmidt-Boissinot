Supplied A 10-year-old boy's trip to the shop ended up with a midnight trip to hospital after he swallowed a $2 coin meant for an icecream. The Tauranga boy, his brother and sister were on their way to their local shop to buy an icecream about 4pm on Sunday. The boy's father, radio identity Grayson Ottaway, said his son could not remember what happened next, other than the moment of swallowing the $2 coin. "It was a bit traumatic for him. We seem to think he was playing around and had it sitting in the side of his mouth, maybe he was tying his shoes laces or something," Mr Ottaway said. "He seems to remember when he swallowed it, then the instant reaction was that he vomited. It was that gag reflex." Mr Ottaway's son continued to throw up when he got home, with the gag reflexes out of control. "He was really violently ill and, of course, his mother was wondering what the hell was going on," he said. "She was thinking 'maybe it's something he'd eaten'. Then he said 'Mum, what happens if you swallow a bit of metal?"' The boy was taken to Tauranga Hospital where an X-ray revealed the golden culprit sitting wedged in his oesophagus. "They looked at the X-ray and saw where it was and said there's no way he's going to be able to cough that up." Transfer plans were made to take Mr Ottaway's son to Waikato Hospital, where he could be operated on and the coin safely removed. Mr Ottaway said the incident left his son too weak to stand that day but he was grateful it was not in his windpipe. The boy was given a general anaesthetic about midnight and taken into theatre, where doctors used long medical tongs to retrieve the coin. "It literally took 15 minutes, if that," Mr Ottaway said. Yesterday, his son was back to normal and a "chirpy little bugger". "He's absolutely fine now," his father said. The boy said although his ordeal was scary the rescue helicopter flight was fun. He said he was really sick but was now feeling "good, just a bit sore" in his throat. Mr Ottaway asked that his son not be named but said it was important to get the message out there of how easily something like this could happen. Medical experts say they often see children who have swallowed dangerous and foreign objects. Waikato Hospital clinical nurse manager Diana Knight said she had seen children swallow pins, coins, hard biscuits, keys and more. Ms Knight said if a child had swallowed something and it was lodged in the throat, provided they were still breathing, people should try to keep the child calm, conscious and alert. "If the child is unconscious, turn them over and give them firm pats on the back, this may dislodge the object enough to allow air in. Take the child to an emergency department." She said the best advice for parents, particularly of babies who were crawling, was to regularly vacuum and keep things off the floor. "Babies will eat anything," she said. John Bonning, clinical unit leader, said the most dangerous thing for any child to swallow was button batteries, which were dangerous and must be removed surgically. "Make your house child-proof. Keep laundry items locked up and 'grandma's pills" out of the way," Dr Bonning said. Senior doctor at Tauranga Hospital Tina Bergen said the emergency department saw on average one case every few weeks of an adult or child swallowing an object.
