According to Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious-disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, it has happened before and it could happen again.Major disease outbreaks are a very real risk when masses of people gather in one place, he said, such as at the upcoming London Olympics this summer.To help better prepare, a team of Canadian researchers is working with British authorities to track and anticipate the risk for an infectious disease outbreak during the event.The international collaboration, marking the first time experts from around the world are combining technologies for global disease surveillance, is documented in a research paper published today in the scientific journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases."Mass gatherings are a phenomenon that are not really all that understood," said Khan, lead author of the paper, in an interview.Historically, when countries host mass gatherings, they tend to focus their attention locally where the gathering is occur-ring, he said."They have control over that jurisdiction and can do whatever they need to do," he explained.The downside of that approach, however, is that, "by definition, you're always then responding to an outbreak and not actually looking for ways to prevent it," said Khan.When people from around the world travel to one place for an event, it is both a global and a local phenomenon, he explained."You have global populations that are converging in a single point," he explained."And then when the gathering is over, then those individuals are diverging and going back to the places that they came from."That makes the risk of disease outbreak challenging to monitor, but Khan and his team have come up with a tracking system that combines two cutting-edge surveillance technologies.The first is a system developed by John Brownstein, one of the authors of the paper. Browstein is from Montreal, and is also an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard University and developer of HealthMap.org, an Internet-based global infectious disease intelligence system.The technology works by tracking potential outbreaks in real-time through constantly scanning the web to see what people are talking about online."It's looking at social media trends and Twitter, that kind of thing, and looking for early signals of what types of infectious disease threats might be out there," said Khan.While government reports of outbreaks are accurate, their value as a disease prevention tool is limited as the information takes weeks, sometimes even months, to gather."As you can imagine, during a mass gathering, that lack of timeliness can be problematic," he said.But tracking diseases in real time allows for public health authorities to begin preparing for a potential outbreak before a major event even begins, said Khan."We usually start to focus our attention in the two weeks or so before a mass gathering and start really honing in on what types of disease outbreaks would be happening around the world," he said.Having too much information can be overwhelming, said Khan.To help narrow the search, the technology is combined with the Bio.Diaspora, a sys-tem Khan developed that uses air traffic patterns to predict the spread of infectious disease."It's essentially understanding how the world is moving through the global airline transportation network," Khan explained.Since developing Bio. Diaspora, Khan has studied more than 4,000 airports, 700 airlines, and the individual movements of over two billion passengers every year.The information is anonymous, he added.In the weeks ahead of the London Olympic Games, the two surveillance systems will allow health officials to anticipate disease outbreaks, symptoms of which some British medical experts may have never even encountered before."Now health officials can start to consider ... notifying front-line medical providers in saying there's a possibility some-one with these symptoms and this type of disease may walk into your emergency room," said Khan.The main message, said Khan, is for people to make sure that they are healthy and have received their vaccinations before travelling.Â© Copyright (c) The Vancouver SunÂ Â Â E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this ArticleÂ Â Â Â Location refreshed Â Story ToolsÂ E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleÂ Font:*****Â Image:****Â Â Â Â Â Â Related Topics Kamran KhanContagious and Infectious DiseasesHealth and Fitness Most Popular News Most Read E-mailed Commented Sidney Crosbyâs NHL doomsday clock resumes ticking Petra Kvitova recovers to advance at Australian Open Canucksâ Kesler not happy with coach Vigneault's critique of his game Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Ducks catch rival Canucks on a 'fowl' night Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Â more Â» RSS Deepak Chopra yoga centre opens in Vancouver Soccer mom jailed for siphoning more than $200,000 from Richmond youth Snow flurries and cold weather set to continue across Metro Vancouver Sarah Burke not improving, still critical, sedated days after ski crash Most stressful jobs of 2012 Conceal baby's sex due to Asian abortion trend: CMAJ editorial Â more Â» RSS Sponsored By Breaking News Alerts Sign up to receive e-mail alerts on breaking news from The Vancouver Sun.
